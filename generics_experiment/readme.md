### Experiment notes

- We may encounter a lot of implicit domain restriction when "people" is the subject NP (e.g., "people have little cubicles"; also, in general, even when it's not "people'). We may consider asking a question to elicit the implicit domain e.g., "what do you think the speaker is referring to when he says 'people'?".
- Exclude gerunds ? (e.g., "People are saying blah blah "), or more generally, things in the progressive tense.
- Do we have enough context? We may want to add a little of what comes after the target utterance
