### Experiment notes

- We may encounter a lot of implicit domain restriction when "people" is the subject NP (e.g., "people have little cubicles"; also, in general, even when it's not "people'). We may consider asking a question to elicit the implicit domain e.g., "what do you think the speaker is referring to when he says 'people'?".
- Do we have enough context? We may want to add a little of what comes after the target utterance 
- Identify that there's an adjective (e.g., "political things don't interest me a great deal")
- Identify when the property involves the speaker (e.g., "...don't interest me a great deal"), and replace the pronoun in the question (e.g., "dont interest Speaker 1 a great deal?")


### To exclude 
- Exclude gerunds ? (e.g., "People are saying blah blah "), or more generally, things in the progressive tense.
- Occurences in relative clauses (e.g., "Those are the games that politicians play.")
- Need to decide if we include vague quantifiers (e.g., "a lot, many")
- explicit comparatives (e.g., "*more* people are interested in spending time with their kids *now*")
  - is there a way to test for explicit comparative within the generic (e.g., "murders are incredibly lower than the united states")
  - might need to exclude specific words (e.g., "more", or anything that ends in an "-er")
