276:7	###SpeakerA121 . ###Yeah . E_S ###You know \[ it 's , \+ it *EXP*-1 's \] interesting \[ that , \+ that \] \[ a lot , \+ \] the population of the United States is changing because , you know , uh , now that so many more minorities , where they have had extended families for such a long time *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerB122 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA123 . ###Um , matter of fact in the United States we used *-1 to have extended families . E_S ###SpeakerB124 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###SpeakerA125 . ###It was n't , E_S ###SpeakerB126 . ###true . E_S ###SpeakerA127 . ###But , I guess 0 as we become more industrialized and more , you know , less in a rural situation \[ \[ \[ \[ we , \+ we do n't , \] \+ we , \] \+ we , \] \+ we \] choose *-1 not to deal with the , extended family because we feel 0 it 's kind of cumbersome , when in reality it makes things much much easier *T*-2 . E_S 
733:34	###and it 's , N_S ###if you keep up with movies , it 's kind of interesting . E_S ###There 's a certain a mount of dribble that they do *T*-1 . E_S ###\[ They 've got , \+ uh , they 've got \] a couple of kids , ten or twelve years old , E_S ###and they call in E_S ###and they review movies . E_S ###But it 's , uh N_S ###SpeakerB46 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###\[ he , \+ anyway , he , \] N_S ###it 's interesting . E_S ###You listen to him E_S ###and then \[ you , \+ you \] go *-1 watch the movie . E_S ###In fact , \[ they had , \+ people had \] just seen , N_S 
1057:6	###There 's less of a sense of privacy . E_S ###In fact , it *EXP*-2 's said *-1 that no Indian language has a word for privacy , E_S ###certainly the language 0 I know *T*-1 does n't , but just says a word for loneliness . E_S ###SpeakerB74 . ###Oh , that 's interesting . E_S ###SpeakerA75 . ###Loneliness *ICH*-2 is the closest 0 you can come *T*-1 , which *T*-3 is really quite different . E_S ###SpeakerB76 . ###\[ But , \+ but \] no concept for * wanting *-1 to be private . E_S ###SpeakerA77 . ###Yeah . E_S ###\[ It 's , \+ it 's \] generally 0 * being alone is not a very desirable state , at least officially . E_S ###SpeakerB78 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerA79 . 
1074:14	###People do n't tend *-1 to knock , E_S ###you just , N_S ###if there 's a door closed and you open it because it 's in your way E_S ###\[ you , \+ people \] walk in out E_S ###and , \[ as a , \+ as a \] westerner in India , \[ and \+ \] I was often surprised *-1 , and felt 0 my sense of privacy there was quite invaded . E_S ###SpeakerB80 . ###Oh . E_S ###\[ \[ That , \+ that \] would be , \+ That would be \] culturally shocking . E_S ###SpeakerA81 . ###SpeakerB82 . ###SpeakerA83 . ###You know , it very much is *?* . E_S ###But on the other hand , I realized 0 I could go out on the street and act like a complete lunatic , E_S ###SpeakerB84 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
1075:4	###you just , N_S ###if there 's a door closed and you open it because it 's in your way E_S ###\[ you , \+ people \] walk in out E_S ###and , \[ as a , \+ as a \] westerner in India , \[ and \+ \] I was often surprised *-1 , and felt 0 my sense of privacy there was quite invaded .

E_S ###But on the other hand , I realized 0 I could go out on the street and act like a complete lunatic , E_S ###SpeakerB84 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA85 . 
1096:9	###and they start *-1 asking questions and in the sense are \[ \[ invite- , \+ invade , \] \+ invading \] your privacy although , if you know what the social norms are *T*-2 , you know , quote unquote , you asked for it . E_S ###But it does mean that you have yet another reason 0 *-1 to follow a set of social norms *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerB88 . ###Yes . E_S ###SpeakerA89 . ###\[ And \+ \] which *T*-1 is n't \[ of , \+ \] always the case in all cultures , E_S ###and it was n't until I was thinking about it just now that I realized 0 that 's actually something that *T*-1 's culturally relative . E_S ###SpeakerB90 . ###\[ Tha- , \+ that \] is true . E_S ###I have n't thought about that E_S ###\[ and , \+ and \] that it *EXP*-2 's fascinating * \[ to , \+ to \] think a lot of someone who *T*-1 does n't know how *-3 to say private *T*-4 . E_S ###SpeakerA91 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###uh-huh . E_S ###And that 's really , um , N_S 
1112:45	###SpeakerB92 . ###SpeakerA93 . ###I mean , \[ they a- , \+ \] , N_S ###you go to India E_S ###and \[ it 's obvious , \+ you know , the results of sex are quite obvious , \] , as the population goes up an extra hundred million every few years . E_S ###Um , but \[ I , \+ I \] just do n't quite , um , N_S ###there 's hope , ###I actually ###for al- , N_S of the time 0 I 've spent *T*-1 there , I still do n't quite understand how certain things that I assume 0 *T*-2 and require privacy and require not just that you be alone but actually that you have a sense of privacy *T*-3 . E_S ###SpeakerB94 . ###Yes . E_S ###SpeakerA95 . ###Because anyone can be alone for some period of time E_S ###but for me a lot of what I do *T*-1 requires a sense that there 's this invisible barrier around me which people \[ wil- , \+ will \] respect *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerB96 . 
1131:42	###SpeakerB98 . ###That 's interesting . E_S ###\[ Are th- , \+ are there \] any other specific things \[ \[ that , \+ that \] you feel like , \+ \[ where , \+ where \] you feel \] your privacy to be invaded *-1 on a day-to-day basis or either on a growing frequency *T*-2 ? E_S ###SpeakerA99 . ###All \[ the class- , \+ the other classic \] examples , the Jehovah 's Witness \[ or , \+ or \] Mormons or someone knocking at the front door , um , which *T*-1 is more intrusive because I have *-2 to really tell someone *-3 to go away . E_S ###And there 's that sense of , I have now opened my door ###they now see what I look like *T*-1 , what I live like *T*-2 E_S ###\[ and nor- , \+ and they 're \] doing something that normally I really only invite , people to *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB100 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerA101 . ###Because I , \[ \[ \[ any , \+ anyone , \] \+ any friend , \] \+ anyone \] 0 I give my number to *T*-1 is welcome *-2 to call me , E_S ###but no one is just welcome *-1 to come by my house . E_S ###So that is more of a sense of invasion . E_S ###SpeakerB102 . 
1415:7	###I mean I ca n't think of a field that they 're not involved in *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerA30 . ###Oh , I ca n't either , ###not a one . E_S ###SpeakerB31 . ###And I know 0 at least in the medical field , it seems like they 've come out with a lot further advances as far as female medications and things since women have gotten into the doctor field . E_S ###SpeakerA32 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB33 . ###I do n't think that men really took the time 0 * to work on that sort of thing *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA34 . ###Yeah , E_S ###even in Washington , you know , there seems *-1 to be a lot more women involved . E_S ###SpeakerB35 . ###Yeah . E_S 
1421:92	###SpeakerA32 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB33 . ###I do n't think that men really took the time 0 * to work on that sort of thing *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA34 . ###Yeah , E_S ###even in Washington , you know , there seems *-1 to be a lot more women involved . E_S ###SpeakerB35 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA36 . ###SpeakerB37 . ###Hopefully , the next generation , it wo n't even be an issue , E_S ###I mean people will just look at you as a person and not as a man or a woman , E_S ###SpeakerA38 . ###Yeah , E_S 
1585:22	###you know , when that subject comes up *T*-1 they can say yes , E_S ###that would be wonderful . E_S ###SpeakerA92 . ###Yes , E_S ###oh , I do too . E_S ###SpeakerB93 . ###Plus , I bet 0 it \[ cuts , \+ cuts \] down on your absenteeism because you 've got two days off that you can do everything *T*-1 , E_S ###so you do n't have *-1 to *?* , you know , unless you 're just really sick , or the child 's sick . E_S ###SpeakerA94 . ###Most of the time now , you know , it 's just the weekend , E_S ###or * just forget it . E_S ###SpeakerB95 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###oh yeah , E_S ###I have *-1 to plan way in advance , because , N_S 
1640:14	###SpeakerA108 . ###Oh , I do too . E_S ###SpeakerB109 . ###but I think 0 that 's improving . E_S ###It 's such a slow process E_S ###it 's frustrating , E_S ###but , you can see that it 's wrong E_S ###SpeakerA110 . ###Yes , E_S ###yes . E_S ###SpeakerB111 . ###and you just want *-1 to make it right , E_S ###but at least the wheels are moving forward . E_S ###SpeakerA112 . ###They really are *?* . E_S 
2613:4	###you wear coordinated suits . E_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###\[ I coul- , \+ I could n't \] afford *-1 to work there . E_S ###SpeakerB54 . ###\[ And , \+ and \] a particular kind of shoe , you know , so high heel , E_S ###oh it is spelled *-1 out . E_S ###SpeakerA55 . ###Oh , no . E_S ###SpeakerB56 . ###When I was looking at her materials *T*-1 when she first started , you know , *T*-2 she had her benefits package and all that kind of stuff . E_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB58 . ###And it told about the dress code E_S ###and it said , 0 these are the color pastel shirts 0 you may wear *T*-1 , 
2720:11	###So that 's just , N_S ###SpeakerA87 . ###Is n't that funny . E_S ###SpeakerB88 . ###With \[ the , \+ you know , the \] little suspenders or something on E_S ###so . \[ We 've , \+ we 've \] kind of had a variety there E_S ###SpeakerA89 . ###That 's great . E_S ###SpeakerB90 . ###but , I think 0 a lot of times \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] mainly who they 're going *-1 to meet with *T*-2 , E_S ###or they 're meeting with people that they know 0 *T*-2 is going *-3 to be dressed *-4 that way then that 's how they are *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA91 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB92 . ###If they 're just going *-1 to be meeting with T I -ers like * to talk about a patent kind of thing and \[ the , \+ they 're \] engineers that they 're talking too *T*-2 , they dress kind of like how the engineers are dressed *T*-3 E_S 
3692:182	###SpeakerA17 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###and , we just do all kinds of fun things like that E_S ###an . N_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###Yeah , E_S ###we have family that *T*-1 's far away . E_S ###It sounds like you might *?* too . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###Yeah , E_S ###we do , E_S ###so \[ they , \+ you know , the only way 0 they \] know their grandparents *T*-1 is by pictures . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###Yeah . E_S 
3832:6	###and it 's like , during the week , E_S it 's like five dollars admission per child , all day . E_S ###SpeakerA65 . ###\[ And , \+ and \] you said 0 about Plano and Campbell is *T*-1 the petting , E_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###The petting farm , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA67 . ###That sounds fun E_S ###I think 0 maybe we 'll try *-1 to do that . E_S ###SpeakerB68 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah E_S ###and the one in Mesquite is , uh , Scyene exit . E_S ###SpeakerA69 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
4492:112	###SpeakerA91 . ###Boy , E_S ###SpeakerB92 . ###Do you think 0 the program came first or the , N_S ###SpeakerA93 . ###yeah , E_S ###that , N_S ###there 's a , N_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] can say 0 there 's a correlation , ###but I could n't say \[ which , \+ which \] *T*-1 caused the other . E_S ###\[ They sort of , dev- , \+ you know , each developed \] a little bit and then would feed off one another and develop a little bit more , and a little bit more . E_S ###SpeakerB94 . ###Yeah , E_S ###the more money 0 they put *T*-1 into it . E_S ###SpeakerA95 . 
4811:9	###SpeakerA51 . ###yeah , E_S ###* to go ahead and let them go , E_S ###but if they do it again and they really need *-1 to face the consequences then , uh . N_S ###SpeakerB52 . ###Well , yeah , E_S ###* use that E_S ###or , you know , there 's other consequences rather than * killing them , you know , E_S ###you could , always make them the slave of the people 0 they committed the crime against *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerB54 . ###SpeakerA55 . ###Huh-uh . E_S ###SpeakerB56 . 
4977:19	###or what *T*-1 's even worse , is 0 they promote them into a position that they ca n't handle *T*-3 and let them get fired *-2 . E_S ###SpeakerA111 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB112 . ###Or , one thing or the other . E_S ###You look at another kind of society like the Japanese . E_S ###You put that many people on that small of a space , they 've learned *-1 to live together . E_S ###Okay . E_S ###It 's in their culture . E_S ###SpeakerA113 . ###Huh-uh . E_S ###SpeakerB114 . ###And one of the things that *T*-1 's in their culture that I really think 0 the major corporations should pay attention to *T*-2 , is the fact that , while Japan was becoming a great power , financially , the people that *T*-3 worked for those companies , worked for the same company 0 they worked for *T*-4 at sixty-five , as they did when they were eighteen *T*-5 . E_S ###SpeakerA115 . ###Teen . E_S 
6018:35	###And the main , N_S ###SpeakerA183 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Because see what *T*-1 happens is 0 they have a good backup policy . E_S ###SpeakerB184 . ###SpeakerA185 . ###And anybody can fix it . E_S ###SpeakerB186 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA187 . ###And so that 's what you 're going *-1 to go for *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerB188 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Well , you know , \[ \[ that 's , \+ that 's a , \] \+ that 's a \] big thing . E_S ###SpeakerA189 . 
6502:52	###I do n't know , E_S ###but I think 0 it would be a great idea . E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###* Seems like there 's so many kids that *T*-1 do n't have any since of , you know , what they want *-2 to be *T*-3 or do *T*-3 E_S ###or , you know , they could learn something and maybe help other people at the same time E_S ###and \[ \[ we , \+ sure , our country , \] \+ all countries sure \] need help E_S ###so , N_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###Huh-uh . E_S ###\[ Would , \+ uh , would \] you be more in favor of , uh , you know , like a local , uh , N_S ###my only experience with it , I was in Central America *ICH*-1 for a while , and , uh , in San Salvador , in El Salvador , E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###Huh-uh . E_S 
6840:4	###and also that *T*-1 have elderly couples *ICH*-4 once their kids have left , that *T*-2 can volunteer *-3 to go on a mission E_S ###and , um , they 're all over the world . E_S ###And , it 's incredible logistics , E_S ###I mean , they have a training center where they teach them *T*-1 , E_S ###it 's called *-1 the Missionary Training Center in Utah , E_S ###and they have , *-1 to be taught *-2 the language and customs and all those kinds of things , E_S ###SpeakerA131 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB132 . ###and then they , um , you know , go and actually live in that country for \[ the , \+ the , \] uh , N_S ###young men do it for two years and the young women for eighteen months . E_S ###SpeakerA133 . ###Okay . E_S ###Then that 's , uh , kind of a private organization , E_S ###SpeakerB134 . 
6851:7	###SpeakerA133 . ###Okay . E_S ###Then that 's , uh , kind of a private organization , E_S ###SpeakerB134 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA135 . ###you know , \[ I 'm , \+ I 'm \] familiar with , N_S ###my instructor pilot was a Mormon , E_S ###\[ he was , \+ he was \] a good \[ construction , \+ uh , you know , \[ in- , \+ instructor \] \] pilot because he considered himself indestructible , E_S ###SpeakerB136 . ###Oh , yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA137 . ###SpeakerB138 . ###He had a direct connection somewhere , uh , E_S ###SpeakerA139 . 
7517:49	###and so it 's , uh , quite the opposite , E_S ###so elections start *-1 getting very , uh , N_S ###the elections where they have that topic *T*-2 seem *-1 to be a little bit better *ICH*-3 attended than some of the other ones . E_S ###SpeakerA28 . ###Yeah , E_S ###that 's true . E_S ###SpeakerB29 . ###But , uh , N_S ###SpeakerA30 . ###Yeah , E_S ###that 's true that the different places in America that , uh , you know , different issues would be a lot more important than say in another place . E_S ###SpeakerB31 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I can understand \[ why , \+ why \] some of \[ the , \+ the \] rural areas , the voter turnout is n't as much because it does seem sometimes like the lobbyists in D C are like controlling things for \[ the , \+ the \] Midwest *T*-1 , E_S ###SpeakerA32 . 
8250:18	###SpeakerA207 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB208 . ###It was okay , E_S ###it was kind of slow , E_S ###and I felt like it kind of got chopped *-1 off at the end , you know . E_S ###\[ It just , \+ it , \] N_S ###I do n't know , E_S ###\[ it \+ one of those movies 0 *T*-1 it 's \] not going *-2 to be around long , E_S ###it will be a dollar movie in no time . E_S ###SpeakerA209 . ###Do you read ? E_S ###SpeakerB210 . ###Not very much , E_S ###no . E_S 
9128:4	###SpeakerA19 . ###SpeakerB20 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###Um , \[ I , \+ I \] do n't know if you \[ he- , \+ \[ re- , \+ \] heard \] about the , uh , recent legislation in , uh , Colorado , uh , against a power company , uh , that *T*-1 's actually on Indian land , I believe 0 *T*-2 , E_S ###but , uh , it has been ruled against *-1 , uh , regarding air pollution because they think that it 's causing terrible smog over the Grand Canyon . ###And , um , particularly in the winter months . E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###Um . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###So they , N_S ###it was , uh , a landmark case because it *EXP*-1 's unusual * to , um , N_S ###I can , N_S ###\[ they , \+ they \] were talking about * shutting it down , \[ or \+ \] if it did n't comply and so on . E_S ###SpeakerB24 . 
9218:81	###SpeakerB50 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###And , uh , I do n't know how long \[ that , \+ that \] will take *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB52 . ###People also have *-1 to realize 0 they ca n't have their cake and eat it . E_S ###So , if you do n't want *-1 to burn coal for power , how about \[ nucle- , \+ nuclear \] energy . E_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###Sure . E_S ###SpeakerB54 . ###Well we do n't want that either . E_S ###SpeakerA55 . ###Exactly , E_S ###yeah , E_S ###right . E_S 
9249:39	###and \[ they do n't want , \+ they do n't want \] *-1 to pay for it . E_S ###So instead , we spend billions of dollars *-1 going to war . E_S ###SpeakerB62 . ###Yes . E_S ###SpeakerA63 . ###Uh , you know , wha- , N_S ###however , it might have had other causes . E_S ###Certainly oil was a big factor . E_S ###SpeakerB64 . ###Oh certainly , E_S ###yes . E_S ###SpeakerA65 . ###Um , and I think 0 that 's probably going *-1 to happen \[ with , \+ with \] such things as air pollution , ###\[ when we , \+ when we \] \[ se- , \+ get serious \] \[ about cleaning , \+ about our motors \] in our automobiles *T*-2 \[ then , \+ uh , then \] maybe , you know , we 'll have a little bit of help . ###Um , uh , E_S 
9833:36	###people were just as violent before T V was invented *-1 , ###maybe even more so . E_S ###SpeakerA115 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB116 . ###But I guess 0 \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] a different topic E_S is n't it *?* ? . E_S ###SpeakerA117 . ###Probably so . E_S ###Well , I think 0 \[ that 's about , \+ uh , that 's about \] covered it for me , E_S ###so I think 0 I 'll say good-bye E_S ###and we 'll talk another time perhaps . E_S ###SpeakerB118 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Well , it *EXP*-1 was nice * talking to you . E_S ###* \[ Tell me , \+ tell me \] where you 're calling from *T*-1 . E_S 
10415:4	###SpeakerB54 . ###Oh yes , E_S ###absolutely nuts . E_S ###But , uh , luckily enough , you know , we found the cat in time and , uh , rushed him to the vet E_S ###and it took us about six weeks of in and out of the vet and surgery E_S ###and , tod- , N_S ###SpeakerA55 . ###Oh Lord . E_S ###SpeakerB56 . ###I mean he started off as a stray E_S ###and then we did all this for him . E_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###Oh man . E_S ###SpeakerB58 . ###But oh , he 's been a wonderful cat . E_S 
10710:6	###SpeakerB160 . ###Right , E_S ###I 'm so glad my husband is a cat person because if he was a dog person , no , it would n't have worked . E_S ###SpeakerA161 . ###It would n't have *?* , E_S ###no E_S ###that would be a problem . E_S ###SpeakerB162 . ###Oh that 's one of the requirements 0 I asked him *T*-1 . E_S ###I said , now you do like cats , right . E_S ###We do n't li- , N_S ###SpeakerA163 . ###Have you seen those , uh , N_S ###do you ever read COSMO . E_S ###SpeakerB164 . 
11134:8	###it 's just that sometimes it 's not the right people , which *T*-1 is \[ really , \+ really \] sad because , I wish 0 we would do more . E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###At work we started , uh , all the recycling stuff . E_S ###They 're really trying , E_S ###I think 0 what *T*-1 started it at work was that planet earth thing 0 we had *T*-2 last year . E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###Yes . E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###And , uh , that really , started a lot of stuff off , E_S ###but , you know sometimes it dwindles down . E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###Yeah , E_S ###where I work *T*-1 now we recycle all the computer paper . E_S 
11872:4	###and they 've got this black ash *ICH*-3 on their cars , which *T*-1 , you know , seems *-2 to be , N_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###SpeakerB28 . ###SpeakerA29 . ###Yeah , E_S ###surprise , surprise . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I mean , I really think that if the E P A had anything on the ball they 'd go in there with a few phosphorous grenades , light up the sky , photograph the emissions at that point , and , uh , you know , N_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###Yeah . E_S ###\[ There , \+ there \] must be , uh , uh , \[ some of the , \+ some of the , \] uh , larger plants \[ up , \+ uh , up \] around one hundred twenty-eight . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA33 . 
13191:25	###when they finished high school *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###I think 0 probably as soon as they finished high school it would be ideal , because a lot of times , \[ i- , \+ if \] they go straight into college I think 0 they 're going in too quick E_S ###but , N_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###I think particular boys that the maturity , N_S ###in fact I was n't very mature when I left high school *T*-1 E_S ###and I think 0 \[ there 's a , \+ there 's a \] real challenge there . E_S ###There 's also \[ this , \+ this \] issue \[ of , \+ of , \] uh , you know , whether you 're really ready , E_S ###and I think 0 it gives a different perspective . E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###Right , E_S ###uh , y- , N_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] think 0 if you 've been out of school a \[ year , \+ year \] and a half , before you start to college , you appreciate college more , than someone that *T*-1 just goes right straight into college . E_S ###SpeakerA11 . 
13453:10	###SpeakerA63 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB64 . ###SpeakerA65 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###So I try *-1 to , N_S ###I actually during that period of time \[ from , \+ you know , usually from \] six o'clock or six thirty , whenever I get home *T*-1 , until eight or so , I will shut off the phone E_S ###SpeakerA67 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB68 . ###and , uh , my daughter gets irate , \[ when I , \+ when I \] do that *T*-1 because , you know , she 's a teenager E_S ###SpeakerA69 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB70 . 
13490:38	###and I can call them back . E_S ###SpeakerB78 . ###That 's right . E_S ###SpeakerA79 . ###But , uh , at work I have so many phone calls from customers calling in , E_S ###sometimes \[ it is just , \+ I just want \] *-1 to get away from the phone ringing because \[ it , \+ it \] really does annoy me .

E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###Oh , definitely . E_S ###I think better even \[ than , \+ than \] other kinds of food .

17103:24	###\[ That 's , \+ that 's \] about the hardest thing is , who *T*-1 's related to who .

18838:16	###SpeakerB58 . ###Well , I understand that , you know . ###MUMBLEx E_S ###if , needs and wants were the same I 'd have a four eighty-six machine at home .

19028:42	###SpeakerA55 . ###No , E_S ###I think 0 \[ it 's , \+ it *EXP*-2 's , \] to me more of a convenience *ICH*-4 * to have them come *-3 pick it up , then * to get that two cents when you take it to the store *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB56 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###SpeakerB58 . ###Oh , \[ I , \+ oh , I \] know it .

19183:28	###\[ It , \+ they \] really have *-1 to rely on businesses that *T*-2 generate a lot of that stuff . E_S ###SpeakerB122 . ###Right .

E_S ###SpeakerB124 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA125 . ###SpeakerB126 . ###Right . E_S ###Oh , I was thinking about , you know , like \[ the , \+ uh , the \] Styrofoam used * at , uh , the fast-food restaurants , that if everybody , uh , N_S ###SpeakerA127 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB128 . 
19933:17	###SpeakerB120 . ###No . E_S ###SpeakerA121 . ###And there 's THE HISTORY OF YOAKUM COUNTY , TEXAS there .

22414:4	###SpeakerB110 . ###Uh-huh , uh , E_S ###I did n't know that about Burlington , E_S ###I 'll have *-1 to keep that in mind . E_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###Okay .

E_S 
24791:16	###and they ca n't do that . E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###Yeah . E_S ###I know 0 down here the schools are , you know , N_S ###I do n't know , E_S ###they rate , N_S ###I moved to Arkansas and Texas after *-1 living in Ohio E_S ###and the schools down here rate , you know , *-1 bottom ten percent across the country E_S ###and *-1 having been through grade school up there and coming down here to high school I can understand why . E_S ###Because they 're so far behind and so poorly staffed *-2 , half the time the teachers do n't know what *T*-1 's going on . E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###Well , that 's really too bad because \[ it , \+ it 's \] giving some people unfair advantage . E_S ###I mean \[ we , \+ our \] high school up here is like a junior college in Florida E_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###Right . E_S 
25631:20	###SpeakerA67 . ###No . E_S ###SpeakerB68 . ###\[ and , \+ and , \] uh , N_S ###SpeakerA69 . ###And then , you know , we 've got some guys here that *T*-1 they are , you know , four and five handicappers E_S ###SpeakerB70 . ###Uh-huh .

26250:64	###SpeakerB148 . ###So it 's sociology . E_S ###SpeakerA149 . ###\[ It 's , \+ well , it 's \] more psychology and engineering .

27223:6	###SpeakerB128 . ###I think 0 it 's like a lot of things \[ in the , \+ in the \] United States .

27301:27	###SpeakerB166 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA167 . ###You know , they 're just , N_S ###SpeakerB168 . ###Oh , yeah E_S ###it has *-1 to be reinforced *-2 in the home .

27345:10	###And maybe they were a group of Mennonites or something like that . E_S ###SpeakerA181 . ###Uh-huh .

E_S ###SpeakerB186 . 
27907:94	###SpeakerA49 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###and I , N_S ###keys and things are something *ICH*-1 to me that *T*-2 remain a mystery no matter how many times I bang *T*-3 on them .

E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###SpeakerB20 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###So there 's a good combination in the hallways all the time , you know . E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###Well that 's good that they 're so casual . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB24 . 
57463:44	###I have n't gotten really involved in anything , uh , extensive in car repairs in , oh , oh , probably a year or so . E_S ###I think 0 the last thing 0 I did *T*-1 of any significance was * change the water pump on an Oldsmobile . E_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I had a similar thing , that I 've worked on cars ever since I was , uh , a kid .

E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I know what you mean *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###So , you know , * changing the oil , changing the spark plugs N_S ###and most of them now , you know , you do n't go through the ignition stuff anymore because that 's all solid state \[ or , \+ or \] fuel injected E_S ###SpeakerA5 . 
57573:4	###they require plumbers . E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###Well that 's true . E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###And , uh , . N_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###I think 0 the \[ onl- , \+ closest \] thing 0 I 've come *T*-2 \[ to , \+ to \] a diesel is , 0 I 've worked for a tractor repair shop , uh , when I was in high school *T*-1 E_S ###and , uh , we used *-1 to overhaul farm tractors basically , E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###and they were nearly \[ all , \+ all \] diesel , E_S ###but as far as cars I 've never , never been involved with them . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###Well the injector nozzle and stuff in , you know , the big diesel farm tractors , you know , what *T*-1 are about the size of your thumb , E_S and the- , N_S 
58364:14	###and after all , the whole reason 0 * to go over to metric *T*-1 is * to have round numbers , ###so they do n't deal with thirty seconds of an inch E_S ###SpeakerB56 . ###Exactly , E_S ###exactly . E_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###and so what the exact , N_S ###the thing that *T*-1 was best about metric was the thing that *T*-2 was most poorly represented . E_S ###Really , I think . E_S ###SpeakerB58 . ###Well , we do have the two liter soda pop bottles . E_S ###SpeakerA59 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###I saw that , E_S ###I saw that the other day . E_S 
58916:9	###\[ \[ we , \+ we were , \] \+ we tried \] *-1 to move over to Raleigh last year E_S ###and \[ there just was , \+ there was \] \[ so little , \+ such little \] going on in Raleigh , you know , E_S ###you could n't get a job *-1 to save yourself over there E_S ###so we decided 0 we 'll try in a couple of years , E_S ###\[ but , \+ but \] business is , N_S ###SpeakerB165 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah .

E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###Right , E_S 
59058:6	###SpeakerA43 . ###Right , E_S ###and cars and all their books , N_S ###and the books are outrageous . I mean , absolutely outrageous , E_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###Oh , I know , E_S ###I know . E_S ###SpeakerA45 . ###and they 're getting worse . E_S ###Uh , my daughter brought home a book *ICH*-4 the other day that she was going *-1 to have *-2 to have *T*-3 for \[ her , \+ one of her \] next classes E_S ###and it was like ninety-six dollars .

59537:65	###SpeakerA71 . ###What if you 're looking down the barrel of a hand cannon ? E_S ###SpeakerB72 . ###Then it 's still equally matched *-1 .

61455:8	###They 're always , you know , right there *ICH*-1 , and \[ like , \+ like \] you to pet them and loving . E_S ###SpeakerA119 . ###Yeah , E_S ###that 's true .

61550:23	###They like *-1 to roam and investigate . And see what *T*-2 's going on . E_S ###SpeakerA155 . ###Yeah .

62612:56	###I think 0 they deliberately sometimes , um , N_S ###SpeakerB118 . ###I think 0 a lot of things are not made *-1 as well . E_S ###SpeakerA119 . ###Do n't you ?

E_S ###SpeakerB122 . ###but \[ I think that , \+ um , I jus- , \] N_S ###SpeakerA123 . ###That 's good E_S 
63275:6	###You buy a quart of milk , E_S ###and sure it \[ has , \+ has \] the metric equivalent written * on there , E_S ###but it still a quart . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###Oh , yeah , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###But if they started *-1 putting it in liters , \[ liter \+ \] of oil , and you know , liters of gasoline , people are going *-2 to learn *-3 to think in metric .

E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###I kind of remember 0 back when gas prices started up , you know , pretty dramatically *T*-1 when they started *-3 getting toward a dollar a gallon range *T*-2 , E_S somebody had , uh , E_S ###I believe 0 it was Exxon E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###It figures . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . 
63283:81	###As long as you can still buy a product in the English units , that 's how you 're going *-1 to think of it *T*-2 .

E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###we were living in Lubbock at the time , E_S ###they started *-1 marketing it in liters , E_S ###and it was only like twenty-nine and thirty cents a liter . E_S ###So they could put this sign *ICH*-2 out front that *T*-1 said , you know , thirty-nine cents a liter . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###And nobody had any idea what a liter was *T*-1 , E_S 
63465:43	###SpeakerA83 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB84 . ###And until we \[ have * to , \+ have *-1 to \] learn *-2 to think that way , we wo n't *?* . E_S ###SpeakerA85 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Though we call it the English system , E_S ###but I 'm not sure what they do *T*-1 in England now . E_S ###\[ They 're , \+ they 're \] on metric , are n't they *?* ? E_S ###SpeakerB86 . ###Yeah , E_S ###for the most part , I think so . E_S ###SpeakerA87 . ###Yeah , E_S ###except they 've got a , N_S 
63578:61	###SpeakerA115 . ###I know 0 the only other place that I was ever at *T*-1 where they really had it mixed *T*-2 \[ was , \+ was \] in Panama , where 's a lot of the road signs and everything are \[ in , \+ in \] miles per hour *T*-3 E_S ###and some are in kilometers . E_S ###And you got *-1 to know where you are *T*-2 because anything that *T*-3 was the old canal zone is going *-4 to be miles per hour , E_S ###SpeakerB116 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA117 . ###SpeakerA1 . ###* Start . E_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###What kind of recycling programs do you have *T*-1 in Rowlett ? E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Um , th- , N_S ###well right now they 've got a , kind of a central location off of the main highway , E_S ###and they 've got some great big bins there for newspaper , um , plastic , um , I think three bins for glass , white , green , and \[ whatev- , \+ whatever \] other combination there is *T*-1 . E_S 
63753:6	###so the cost of it is higher . E_S ###SpeakerA61 . ###True . E_S ###Yeah , E_S ###I noticed that about things like N_S ###\[ I s- , \+ I seen \] a lot of adds *ICH*-1 recently for organic fertilizers \[ and , \+ and \] lawn additives and that type of thing , E_S ###but the cost \[ is , \+ is \] like , double or sometimes triple , \[ what \+ \] the regular \[ things 0 you , \+ fertilizers and things 0 you \] buy *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB62 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA63 . ###So , in , in terms of that , N_S it 's , N_S ###you know , and , for the environment \[ \[ it 's , \+ it 's , \] \+ there 's \] a good reason 0 * to do it *T*-1 , E_S ###but the cost is kind of prohibitive . E_S ###SpeakerB64 . ###Now , see that 's recycling , you know , E_S 
63857:45	###I think 0 that 's just the biggest problem is keeping it \[ in , \+ in \] front of the public so they understand how serious the problem is *T*-1 , and how important it *EXP*-3 is *T*-2 * to do that . E_S ###SpeakerB98 . ###You know what I 'd like *-1 to see *T*-2 a little more . N_S ###I do n't have any little tiny kids , E_S ###SpeakerA99 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB100 . ###but if they get the little tiny kids saving it now , in five years , when they get bigger *T*-1 , it 'll work a little bit more , too . E_S ###SpeakerA101 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB102 . ###SpeakerA103 . ###True . E_S ###SpeakerB104 . ###Because it 's , N_S 
65588:53	###SpeakerA185 . ###SpeakerB186 . ###\[ So , \+ but \] he 's reading it , E_S ###and he 's r- , N_S ###and he says , He 's so interesting , Mom .

67102:12	###One is more of a distance , N_S ###and one 's more , just , you know , N_S ###they want *-1 to put some equipment on their bike and go for a tour .

67262:12	###so , I 'm more or less out of shape now that I 've been biking , I guess , this year for just a couple of weeks . E_S ###SpeakerA110 . ###Uh-huh .

68474:30	###\[ If it was , \+ if it was \] \[ a , \+ a \] family member of theirs *ICH*-2 , though that *T*-1 was innocent E_S and , then they 'd want *-1 to be on that jury .

69447:43	###so they have *-1 to start *-2 talking about it , or getting their act together about six months ahead * to get in touch with everybody , because they 're rather socially active too .

E_S ###SpeakerA38 . ###SpeakerB39 . ###So it 's really surprising everybody . E_S ###All the developers do n't know what * to do *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA40 . ###Yeah , E_S ###it 's a good time 0 * to buy *T*-1 , if you 're in the market . E_S ###SpeakerB41 . ###Yeah , E_S ###SpeakerA42 . 
85747:23	###you have *-1 to have some compassion some humanness . E_S ###SpeakerB82 . ###That 's right . E_S ###SpeakerA83 . ###* Does n't matter where the boundaries are *T*-1 . ###Um , you know , E_S there are political boundaries E_S ###and those are man made boundaries , E_S ###but , you know , for heaven sakes , that 's something that *T*-1 's been *-2 going on for ages , E_S ###SpeakerB84 . ###and \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 so much of it is what you 're taught *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA85 . ###Yeah , E_S ###that 's true . E_S ###SpeakerB86 . ###You know , they teach their children , uh , in such a way that , N_S 
86529:7	###but , you know , any kind of handgun at all , if it will fit in a handgun and a rifle you would still have *-1 to buy it , or sign up for it , E_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###SpeakerB52 . ###SpeakerA53 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB54 . ###so . N_S ###SpeakerA55 . ###We lived in Tennessee for awhile E_S ###and I bought a pistol there E_S ###and there was a fifteen day waiting period . E_S ###You had *-1 to fill out an application and , go down to the sheriff 's office and get fingerprinted *-2 E_S ###SpeakerB56 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA57 . 
86926:82	###It 's like , you know , hey , everybody has *-1 to be free *-2 to do their own thing . E_S ###And I disagree , E_S ###and I think 0 that 's really contributing to this high rate of crime . E_S ###SpeakerA65 . ###Yes , E_S ###yes . E_S ###Well , I mean , \[ I , \+ I \] guess 0 what I wanted *-3 to say *T*-1 and I stopped , uh , I do not know , I got diverted *-2 , was \[ that , \+ that , \] uh , \[ there 's so mu- , \+ there 's so much \] of a return \[ from pris- , \+ to prison \] that the rehabilitation programs seem *-4 to be a failure . E_S ###\[ And , \+ and \] that is not emphasized *-1 . E_S ###I recognize 0 \[ there 's , \+ there 's \] over crowding problems E_S ###\[ and , \+ and \] since we have decided *-1 to put everybody *ICH*-2 in jail that *T*-3 commits a crime now , \[ that \+ \] that 's complicated the entire process . E_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA67 . ###What I also think that , N_S ###I guess 0 it 's the reflection of the society \[ where , \+ where \] we have so much more mobility and less attachment to , uh , N_S 
87117:33	###SpeakerA43 . ###Oh , yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###Uh , well , I take that back . E_S ###Uh , she ca n't eat some cream cheese . E_S ###But \[ that , \+ that \] really limits , E_S ###SpeakerA45 . ###It sure d- , N_S ###SpeakerB46 . ###um , E_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###it makes you , uh , keep *-1 looking for recipes every time 0 you have an eye out , for something like , N_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###Oh , yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA49 . 
87592:15	###But , uh , I think 0 we do get quite a good value for the tax dollars 0 we spend *T*-1 in most cases . E_S ###What do you think *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###Uh , yeah , E_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] think so . E_S ###\[ \[ \[ I , \+ I 'm , \] \+ uh , I think 0 I 'm , \] \+ I think 0 I 'm , \] uh , a little out of the ordinary in \[ that , \+ that \] \[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ uh , I \] think 0 I 'm more worried about \[ the deficit , \+ the national deficit \] \[ than , \+ than , \] uh , a lot of other people are *?* and think that \[ we need *-1 to , \+ we need *-2 to \] either raise our taxes \[ or , \+ or \] cutback on something E_S ###and I do n't know what * to cutback on *T*-1 * \[ \[ \[ to , \+ to get , \] \+ to get that , \] \+ to get that \] settled *-2 . E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###At this stage it *ICH*-1 's hard , * to tell .

88827:9	###SpeakerB117 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA118 . ###This school does . E_S ###So , uh , \[ It 's , \+ it MUMBLEx \] , N_S ###SpeakerB119 . ###Huh . E_S ###SpeakerA120 . ###\[ I , \+ I \] was involved in some , uh , oh , alumnae recruiting , uh , here in town , uh , recently , uh , well last year . E_S ###SpeakerB121 . ###Uh-huh .

E_S ###SpeakerB123 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
89445:18	###SpeakerA66 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB67 . ###and , uh , cause . Have you been back to the Perry Homes , back here ? E_S ###SpeakerA68 . ###Um , the ones that *T*-1 look like brick houses ? E_S ###SpeakerB69 . ###The one that *T*-1 looks like Monopoly apartments . E_S ###SpeakerA70 . ###Right . E_S ###Yeah , E_S ###I think 0 those are awful . E_S ###I 'm sorry , E_S ###I just do n't see the designer 's , N_S ###I just see him as * trying *-1 to squish \[ as much space , \+ you know , as much house into the space \] as possible . E_S 
89689:73	###and they really can not afford the best . E_S ###SpeakerA32 . ###Right . E_S ###And that 's right , ###\[ I , \+ well I \] took my husband one night to an emergency room when he was in an emergency situation *T*-1 E_S ###and , uh , they brought in a very elderly man from a nursing home who *T*-1 \[ had , \+ had , \] uh , apparently inhaled some chicken 0 he was eating *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerB33 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerA34 . ###And , uh , he \[ had \+ apparently had \] not been in the home too long , just a week or so , E_S ###but when \[ they , \+ the family \] came in *-1 to see him *T*-2 , they had not been made *-3 aware , E_S ###I was in the room when the emergency technicians brought him in from the ambulance *T*-1 E_S ###and I overheard their conversation . E_S ###And when the family walked in *T*-2 , his wife and daughter and son-in-law , they were not even aware of what *T*-1 had happened . E_S ###SpeakerB35 . 
90602:18	###I know that , N_S ###SpeakerA48 . ###\[ Wh- , \+ why \] do you think that it 's less close than it used *-1 to be *?* *T*-2 ? E_S ###SpeakerB49 . ###Well , \[ I , \+ I \] just think \[ that , \+ uh , you know , at that \] ti- , N_S ###\[ when , \+ when \] they were a- , N_S ###you know , \[ the , \+ those \] were all brothers and sisters a lot N_S ###\[ and \+ or \] they were all in the same \[ ar- , \+ geographical \] location . E_S ###SpeakerA50 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###uh-huh , E_S ###uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB51 . ###You know , back around , you know , in the twenties and thirties when they were growing up *T*-1 , uh , you know , they were all located *-2 together , in one small community . E_S ###SpeakerA52 . 
90853:20	###because \[ I , \+ I \] actually teach college , E_S ###\[ I hate *-1 to , \+ uh , I hate *-2 to \] talk to the parents E_S ###\[ because , \+ um one of the reasons is because , \] you know , the kid does n't know exactly what they want *T*-1 , E_S ###and I always say * make * sure 0 you major , in something that you like *T*-1 , even if it 's not going *-2 to be your career vocation , because you 'll get better grades . E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###SpeakerA37 . ###SpeakerB38 . ###SpeakerA39 . ###\[ I , \+ I \] think 0 most employers would probably rather *ICH*-1 hire , you know , \[ a , \+ a \] three six \[ in , \+ um , in \] history , uh , * to be a salesman than someone with a two oh in business administration . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###Oh , yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###Does that make sense ? E_S ###SpeakerB42 . ###Yeah . E_S 
90996:8	###But I don- , N_S ###yeah , E_S ###I think 0 you 're right , E_S ###you really have *-1 to think about that for the job . E_S ###I went to a very small state college when I got my bachelor 's *T*-1 , E_S ###and when I , N_S ###now , I was in education at first when I was looking for jobs *T*-1 , E_S ###I was going *-1 to be a teacher , E_S ###I was just a high school teacher , E_S ###so most people recognized that institution because it was a teaching school sort of , E_S ###SpeakerB88 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA89 . ###you know , but then when I went , um , for graduate work , you know , or for a new job *T*-1 , people said to me , you know , Shippensburg State , ###where is that *T*-1 , you know . E_S 
91756:4	###SpeakerB79 . ###Well , it 's , uh , N_S ###we have , uh , uh , kind of a core group \[ that , \+ that \] *T*-1 serves as , quote , officers of the organization , E_S ###SpeakerA80 . ###Right .

E_S ###Uh , and each year it 's done *-1 a little bit differently , because different people serve in those roles . E_S ###SpeakerA82 . ###Well , that 's pretty MUMBLEx . E_S ###SpeakerB83 . ###We have a biographer \[ who , \+ who \] *T*-1 continues every year *-2 to save clippings on any family member , E_S ###and they 're entered *-1 into \[ a , \+ a \] wonderful , uh , scrap book .

E_S ###SpeakerB85 . ###And they 're very dedicated to that , E_S ###and , uh , it 's been really wonderful . E_S ###It helps 0 you hang onto your roots . E_S ###SpeakerA86 . ###Yeah . E_S 
92420:17	###And , uh , he said , `` I do n't understand . '' E_S ###\[ It 's , \+ it *EXP*-3 's \] real funny that they give the teenagers \[ the , \+ \] as the one that *T*-1 questions , uh , \[ the , \+ what *T*-2 's \] going on .

E_S ###SpeakerA71 . ###And , uh , in the end \[ of , \+ \] uh , the son-in-law , when he did get the mother-in-law up to the cliff *T*-1 , uh , \[ \[ th- , \+ the so- , \] \+ the teenaged son \] throws himself in the way and says , `` No , you ca n't do it , '' ###\[ and then , \+ and then , \] uh , `` Oh , well , we 've got *-2 to do it . ###It 's tradition , '' E_S ###and the son was , you know , `` Why ?

92533:6	###SpeakerB108 . ###I know . E_S ###Who *T*-1 has time ? E_S ###I do n't have time *-2 to sit , I know 0 *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA109 . ###No .

92619:61	###SpeakerA15 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###SpeakerA17 . ###I guess 0 that 's going *-1 to happen . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###SpeakerA19 . ###Yeah , E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###SpeakerA21 . ###a really good effort , E_S ###that 's right , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###But , uh , N_S 
93199:9	###They 're , uh , N_S ###I do n't know . E_S ###It 's just entirely different *ICH*-1 world than this area .

E_S ###SpeakerA68 . ###\[ My , \+ my \] parents retired first to San Diego , E_S ###SpeakerB69 . ###Uh-huh .

93377:39	###SpeakerB131 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA132 . ###SpeakerB133 . ###We really \[ hope , \+ hope \] so . E_S ###SpeakerA134 . ###Well , \[ that , \+ that 's \] really great . ###Uh , E_S ###SpeakerB135 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA136 . ###\[ I , \+ I \] mean , as I said , basically all 0 I 've done *T*-1 is * go back and forth to parents E_S ###and , uh , N_S ###SpeakerB137 . ###Well , \[ \[ that , \+ that 's , \] \+ that 's \] pretty good . E_S 
94119:23	###SpeakerA25 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###we never get them at both of them E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###* Never get them at both places , E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###it seems like , E_S ###so I think 0 we need *-1 to find a new place . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###Right . E_S ###Well , * listen , ###\[ they 've , \+ uh , they 've \] had this one , E_S ###well it just , N_S ###of course , over the years it has , uh , built up as far as the organization is concerned E_S 
94210:8	###and there 's a place 0 \[ they , \+ they \] take the kids up to the lodge and go *-1 swimming up there in the afternoon *T*-2 , E_S ###so \[ it \+ it 's \] a full day . E_S ###SpeakerB62 . ###So there 's lots 0 * to do *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA63 . ###Some of the people come down on Friday afternoon and spend the whole weekend , E_S ###SpeakerB64 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA65 . ###and some just come in for Saturday E_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA67 . ###so , it , uh , has worked out quite well , E_S ###and it 's a chance * to see some of the relatives 0 you do n't see *T*-1 all year long except that once a year . E_S 
94458:40	###but , uh , they still had \[ a , \+ a \] better success rate , simply because they started with a lot better raw material . E_S ###I mean everybody that *T*-1 went to a Catholic school \[ had , \+ uh , at least the parents did , at least , had \] education as a priority like you said and kind of had a whole conducive atmosphere to it . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###Right , E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###SpeakerA21 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###And I wonder if , not so much that , uh , N_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###Well , I think 0 \[ it 's , \+ like you say , \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] \] the socioeconomic mix E_S ###\[ \[ there , \+ you know , the , \] \+ they 're , \] N_S ###you look at the schools like that where you 've got a lot of kids \[ who *T*-1 are basically , \+ uh , that *T*-2 might be \] more \[ well to- , \+ well off , \] you know , going to a private Catholic school or whatever *T*-3 , uh , E_S ###\[ and , \+ and \] they 're not all that way , E_S ###but , you know , some that *T*-1 are *?* um , \[ \[ that , \+ they 're , \] \+ they 're \] not quite the same as the kids that *T*-2 are going to the inner city , uh , you know , public schools . E_S 
94489:63	###\[ It shows , \+ I think 0 it shows \] that the parents have some , uh , desire \[ for , \+ for \] the kid to \[ do , \+ do \] well , you know , E_S ###and that may be passed *-1 on down to the kid as well , E_S ###and , uh , maybe they pick up on that . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###And then from the other aspect , um , maybe the , uh , school itself \[ \[ has , \+ has , \] \+ has \] more emphasis on , uh , *-1 trying *-2 to do a good job because the classes may be smaller , uh , E_S ###they may be able *-1 \[ to , \+ to \] give the resources that *T*-2 's needed *-3 * \[ to , \+ uh , to \] do a good job . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I mean , N_S ###and \[ what do you , \+ what would you do *T*-1 \] *-2 to fix the school systems ? E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###Uh , that 's a tough question how * to fix the school system *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB34 . 
94920:49	###but she said , * let 's go ahead and send him another day , or two days , E_S ###and I promise you faithfully , 0 I will watch the instructor every minute and see exactly what *T*-1 's happening . E_S ###SpeakerA173 . ###Oh , good , E_S ###SpeakerB174 . ###SpeakerA175 . ###Yes , E_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###So do you have P C -s ? E_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###I have a personal computer at home . E_S ###It 's an A T compatible . E_S ###I do n't use it very much any more . E_S ###I used *-1 to use it quite a bit . E_S ###SpeakerA3 . 
95602:39	###SpeakerB34 . ###Yeah , E_S ###it is *?* . E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###For instance , N_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###I 'm a historian , E_S ###and my father had kept them , I think 0 *T*-1 , since nineteen twenty-seven E_S ###\[ and , \+ uh , but \] he burned the ones from twenty-seven to fi- , E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###My goodness . E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###I could not believe 0 he did that , E_S ###\[ but then , \+ so , \] I took the ones from fifty-two on to the present , E_S ###SpeakerA39 . 
95636:47	###I mean \[ it was , \+ it was \] just almost laughable in some instances that , you know , N_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerA49 . ###of course , it 's all relative , of course , E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###I know . E_S ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###but , uh , never the less it *EXP*-1 was fun * to see those figures next to , you know , N_S ###* for a \[ pr- , \+ pair \] of shoes was like five dollars E_S ###and , N_S ###SpeakerB52 . ###I know , E_S ###well even in nineteen sixty-three , N_S 
95975:18	###and we did not have a chance * to do that . E_S ###But , I sure would like *-1 to go back there and do that again . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###Right . E_S ###\[ We are , \+ uh , we have \] not had a vacation in several years , E_S ###so , * be our first chance in awhile , uh , E_S ###we are going *-1 to go to , uh , Destin , Florida , which *T*-2 is a very nice beach area , if you are not familiar with it .

E_S ###Uh , we used *-1 to go quite a bit , uh , before I moved out here . E_S ###We were closer and , uh , used *-1 to go almost every summer , uh , and , rent a condo there on the beach .

96462:59	###SpeakerB134 . ###SpeakerA135 . ###It was real interesting , E_S ###\[ they were . \+ I was \] listening to some of the comments on \[ ra- , \+ television *ICH*-1 \] the other day , uh , about it , E_S ###SpeakerB136 . ###Uh-huh .

97332:43	###SpeakerB92 . ###But that 's unusual .

97657:43	###SpeakerB68 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA69 . ###And , uh , men , uh , \[ have , \+ a lot of them have , \] uh , come around and have seen , the error of their ways . E_S ###SpeakerB70 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA71 . ###SpeakerB72 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA73 . ###But there are a lot of die-hards *ICH*-2 out there that *T*-1 will never change . E_S ###SpeakerB74 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA75 . ###So we have *-1 to , uh , face that reality also . E_S 
97834:74	###Uh , \[ it was , \+ it was \] entertaining , E_S ###but , yeah , E_S ###I do n't think 0 the general audience \[ would , \+ would \] go for it . E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###The most recent one that , uh , my wife and I have seen *T*-1 was the CITY SLICKER . E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###How was that *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###That was excellent . E_S ###It was just \[ a really , \+ a really \] funny movie . E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###That is one 0 I 've been dying *-1 to see *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###At the same time , it had a story line about people trying * to find themselves . E_S ###There were parts that *T*-1 were sad . E_S 
98217:20	###so there 's \[ no , \+ uh , no \] consistency there in the home or whatever . E_S ###There 's no one *-1 to tell them what *T*-2 's right and what *T*-3 's wrong , you know . E_S ###SpeakerA18 . ###Yeah . E_S ###\[ The \+ sort of on my end is *T*-1 more of the \] upper middle class E_S ###so I think 0 our , uh , N_S ###SpeakerB19 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA20 . ###not that we do n't have a certain amount of local problems E_S ###SpeakerB21 . ###Uh-huh E_S ###SpeakerA22 . ###but on the other hand , uh , we get the , uh , affect of \[ the , \+ uh , the \] city E_S ###and , uh , the main crimes within the suburb here are \[ the , \+ the \] theft crimes . A small number of assaults , E_S 
98427:14	###SpeakerB101 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA102 . ###And , yeah , E_S ###if you 're going *-1 to drink , and you may drink , you better have your designated driver . E_S ###SpeakerB103 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA104 . ###In this country , and for example with alcohol or with drugs \[ is , \+ \] we do n't seem *-1 to understand how * to handle it as a society to say \[ okay , \+ it is okay \] under these circumstances , but if you step outside these bounds , the punishment is extreme *T*-2 . ###And we mean it . E_S ###SpeakerB105 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA106 . ###SpeakerB107 . ###Yeah . E_S 
98639:28	###but often juries hear only a fraction \[ of the , \+ of the \] story when they have *-1 to decide guilt or innocence *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerB47 . ###And to me , \[ how can you , \+ how can you \] make a decision if you do n't have all of the evidence in front of , \[ whether it be , \+ whether it pertains \] to the case or not *T*-1 , E_S ###somebody thinks 0 \[ it , \+ it \] had *?* , because they 've got it there . E_S ###SpeakerA48 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB49 . ###So \[ the lawyers , \+ the two lawyers \] are the ones that *T*-1 have all the information . E_S ###SpeakerA50 . ###Yeah , E_S ###and the truth that *T*-1 's brought *-2 out is , uh , as I say , when I 've heard about , you know *T*-3 , N_S ###SpeakerB51 . ###Do n't they ? E_S ###SpeakerA52 . ###the oath is * to tell the truth , E_S 
100012:29	###I work with a lot of elderly people , E_S ###I 'm a trust officer E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###Um . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###and so often they think 0 they 're adequately caring for themselves when they 're really not eating \[ very much \+ or very balanced \] meals *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###Well , she was almost ridiculous . E_S ###Like she 'd eat ice cream and cookies . E_S ###She 'd , N_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###Yes . E_S ###Well you know that 's part of the aging process , That your taste buds goes back to the sweet taste . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###Did n't one , N_S 
100047:4	###I do that right now , E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###and I 'm not near nursing home age . E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###Although they 've got , uh , Meals On Wheels , Which I understand 0 *T*-1 is a really good , you know , way 0 * to handle that so that at least they eat *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###SpeakerA41 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###So as a family you all just visited nursing homes E_S ###or probably in College Station there was n't a whole lot of choice . E_S ###SpeakerB42 . 
100663:67	###But , you know , part of my feeling is that if you \[ solve , \+ help \] them to work through their problems while they 're littler , then they wo n't have as many problems up there . E_S ###SpeakerB58 . ###True . E_S ###I think 0 \[ they , \+ there \] has *-1 to be at least a counselor E_S ###and we just recently had a counselor at elementary . E_S ###We did n't even have counselors in elementary . E_S ###SpeakerA59 . ###Really . E_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###We have always , though , had three at middle schools because we had about a thousand kids E_S ###and they divided them up between three counselors E_S ###but for a good while every year they 'd have a different counselor E_S ###and they decided 0 that did n't work . E_S ###SpeakerA61 . ###Yeah . E_S 
100948:38	###SpeakerB49 . ###Right . E_S ###Right . E_S ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA50 . ###SpeakerB51 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###Yeah , E_S ###that is , uh , a big drawback I think 0 *T*-1 \[ in that , \+ in the , \] uh , public schools out here . You know , to , E_S ###SpeakerA52 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB53 . ###you 're lucky *-1 to have an art teacher E_S ###and if you do you get them once a week or something , you know . E_S ###SpeakerA54 . 
101805:14	###and they start out *-1 very poor . E_S ###* Let 's see , E_S ###that 's a bad tangent 0 * to get on *T*-1 . E_S ###What else *T*-1 has changed between the sixties and the eighties and the nineties ? E_S ###SpeakerA40 . ###Uh , E_S ###SpeakerB41 . ###No . E_S ###SpeakerA42 . ###I think , uh , 0 \[ m- , \+ in my \] situation , N_S ###I have three children E_S ###and we 're , uh , home schooling . E_S ###So , \[ education , \+ you know , things that *T*-1 relate \[ t- , \+ to \] education , \] um , are things that I think about *T*-2 a lot . E_S ###Um , \[ I think 0 that , \+ and I think 0 that \] involves social changes a lot . E_S ###Uh , for instance , I think 0 the schools are having more and more problems because of , uh , things that *T*-1 are happening socially in the world around them and \[ \[ in , \+ in , \] t- , \+ \] because of their parents E_S and things that *T*-1 are being taught *-2 in the home are not taught *-2 in the home , rather . More not than * are *?* . And children being put *-3 in day-care centers from very early , N_S 
101884:4	###They do n't want *-1 to stay home with the kids or something like that . E_S ###SpeakerB69 . ###\[ Y- , \+ yeah \] . E_S ###SpeakerA70 . ###There are a lot of two parent , um , situations where the woman goes back to work because that 's what she wants *-1 to do *T*-2 *T*-3 , you know . E_S ###SpeakerB71 . ###Oh rather than she needs the money just she wants the stimulating environment . E_S ###SpeakerA72 . ###Rather than that , she has *-1 to have the money particularly . E_S ###SpeakerB73 . ###SpeakerA74 . ###SpeakerB75 . ###SpeakerA76 . ###Or , maybe there 's a small need for money E_S ###so she does it partly because of the money but partly for herself , too . You know , E_S 
102082:17	###I mean , we 've gone for Romanian food and Lebanese food , and things like that E_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###Oh , God . E_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###And I 'm not fond of some of those things E_S ###but \[ we 'll try , \+ we 'll try \] anything . E_S ###SpeakerA49 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###\[ Ethiopian , \+ we 've had Ethiopian . \] ###And , uh , not in Plano of course . E_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###No , E_S ###I do n't think so . E_S ###SpeakerB52 . 
103101:22	###SpeakerA33 . ###Yes . E_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###So , I do n't know . E_S ###In Europe there 's a lot of dependency on nuclear power E_S ###and they recycle the fuel E_S ###and then instead \[ of , \+ of , \] N_S ###some people are really afraid * to recycle the fuel because they 're afraid 0 it could become , uh , bomb quality . E_S ###But , that 's the only sensible thing 0 * to do *T*-2 , is * recycle and reuse the fuel and not store it down in the ground . As far as I 'm concerned , where it could eventually , perhaps , there 's some problem , uh , pollute the groundwater *T*-1 . E_S ###So , I do n't know what the answer is *T*-1 . E_S ###The best answer , of course , would be solar or , uh , fusion , or something clean . E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###Yes . E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###Well , we 've got a problem on the line , do n't we . E_S 
103451:14	###SpeakerB83 . ###Really . E_S ###SpeakerA84 . ###And there 's a power structure that you have bow to *T*-1 E_S ###\[ and , \+ and , \] \[ it really is n't , \+ for some people \[ tha- , \+ \] who *T*-1 have been there for over , and over , and over , it really is n't , \] uh , as bad . E_S ###I mean , there 's , N_S ###it 's not that bad of a life as it should be *?* \[ b- , \+ \] for the punishment aspect . E_S ###SpeakerB85 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA86 . ###SpeakerB87 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA88 . ###But the society is turned *-1 against punishment and more towards rehabilitation E_S ###and maybe that 's \[ why , \+ one of the reasons why \] crime has gone up *T*-1 , because it 's not so scary anymore . E_S 
103983:18	###and so outside my little town , we would , uh , go out and look for long neck beer bottle because they were worth something . E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###SpeakerB40 . ###SpeakerA41 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB42 . ###SpeakerA43 . ###Right . E_S ###Do you know , 0 \[ I saw \+ in Tom Thumb yesterday , I saw \] the return to \[ the , \+ uh , the \] small Coke bottles . E_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA45 . ###And I do n't know if there 's a deposit on those or not . E_S ###SpeakerB46 . ###I , N_S 
104480:30	###they can get more somewhere else . E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###Yeah , E_S ###just a little bit of begging will , N_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###Uh , for a good , N_S ###right . E_S ###They 're , N_S ###the nickels , the dimes or what , I suppose 0 it might be quarters , fifty cent pieces in these days , that they would get *T*-1 , \[ they , \+ the kids \] just do n't seem *-2 \[ to , \+ to \] care \[ that , \+ that \] much about a small amount of money . E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###Right . E_S ###Well , I wonder , E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###But , \[ we , \+ we \] did buy a can crusher E_S ###and we are crushing cans E_S 
104742:9	###SpeakerB8 . ###They 've not really given it attention either , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###So it 's not really cured *-1 , E_S ###yeah , E_S ###it 's \[ not , \+ uh , not \] that heavily funded *-1 either E_S ###and then that seems *-1 to be one of \[ the , \+ the \] major , uh , problems that men have *T*-2 in the realm of cancer , E_S ###so , I do n't know . E_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] guess 0 there 's just some strange public opinion as to who they want *-1 to give to *T*-4 . Uh , be it through different organizations , March of Dimes type , uh , telethons \[ or , \+ or \] bicycle rides or whatever , how they fund whatever , uh , illness they wish *T*-2 *T*-3 . E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###It *EXP*-1 's kind of hard * \[ to , \+ to \] get an even keel on that . E_S ###I mean , it 's really hard 0 * to say *T*-1 , E_S 
104860:36	###SpeakerB10 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###And if they are trying *-1 to hide something , then I have *-2 to know that , because \[ we 're t- , \+ we 're talking \] major liabilities . E_S ###Not only with themselves , but with other employees . E_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###And I really , you know , N_S ###\[ they , \+ they 're \] talking about sports and sports personalities and all this stuff that \[ I , \+ I \] would \[ much , \+ much \] prefer *-2 having doctors and airline pilots tested *-1 on a random basis *T*-3 . E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###\[ I , \+ I \] have a real fear , E_S but that at some point something 's going *-1 to happen . E_S ###And they 're showing it with AIDS , E_S 
104957:11	###SpeakerA43 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###I do n't know what the crime is like *T*-1 where you are *T*-2 , E_S ###but the crime rate here is just astronomical . E_S ###SpeakerA45 . ###Ours is changing . E_S ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ ours , \+ ours \] is changing , E_S ###it 's increasing . E_S ###\[ I live in a , \+ I live in a \] very nice suburb E_S ###and \[ \[ it 's , \+ it 's , \] \+ it 's \] unbelievable \[ \[ what , \+ what , \] \+ what *T*-1 's \] going on and \[ the drugs , \+ the selling of drugs . \] E_S ###\[ It 's just , \+ it 's just \] too loose . E_S ###It 's too free . E_S ###SpeakerB46 . 
105019:8	###What are your memories of boating *T*-1 , E_S ###or current , N_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###Uh , about the only memories that I have *T*-1 of boating , uh , N_S ###my husband 's family had \[ a , \+ a \] motor boat , uh , when we got engaged *-2 *T*-1 E_S ###and they took us out on the lake several times . E_S ###And , uh , I really did enjoy that . E_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] do n't know that I ever learned *-1 to drive it or anything , E_S ###but , uh , we did some water skiing *ICH*-1 , of course , \[ and , \+ and , \] uh , * driving around the lake in the boat ###\[ and , \+ and \] just the basic safety rules and things I found *T*-1 real interesting . Uh , you know , E_S ###\[ they , \+ they \] just did n't patrol you like they did with the automobile or whatever . E_S ###\[ The , \+ the \] laws were there E_S ###and if you did n't obey them , uh you know , there were a lot of accidents , I guess . E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Right . E_S 
106188:27	###It *EXP*-1 sure would n't have been Granny 's decision * to leave us and go back to a nursing home , E_S ###but she 's accepted it real well now E_S ###SpeakerB52 . ###Right E_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###so . E_S ###SpeakerB54 . ###well \[ that 's , \+ yeah , that 's \] right that the children have some responsibility *ICH*-1 *ICH*-3 , too , to their parents and such , * to help * decide what *T*-2 's the right thing . E_S ###SpeakerA55 . ###Well , we enjoyed *-1 having her here , E_S ###SpeakerB56 . ###And . N_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###but we feel 0 she 's much safer where she is *T*-1 now . E_S ###She still continues *-1 to fall , E_S 
106188:57	###It *EXP*-1 sure would n't have been Granny 's decision * to leave us and go back to a nursing home , E_S ###but she 's accepted it real well now E_S ###SpeakerB52 . ###Right E_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###so . E_S ###SpeakerB54 . ###well \[ that 's , \+ yeah , that 's \] right that the children have some responsibility *ICH*-1 *ICH*-3 , too , to their parents and such , * to help * decide what *T*-2 's the right thing . E_S ###SpeakerA55 . ###Well , we enjoyed *-1 having her here , E_S ###SpeakerB56 . ###And . N_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###but we feel 0 she 's much safer where she is *T*-1 now . E_S ###She still continues *-1 to fall , E_S 
107176:6	###and I think , like N_S ###I have a friend who *T*-1 just went to , like , Wyoming to some big ranch , you know , where like there were four hundred people for their family reunion *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###Oh , my . E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###And I , N_S ###so I mean , how I would go about *-1 doing it *T*-2 is I would just call all my relatives . E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###Because \[ I , \+ since I \] came from , N_S ###my father has , uh , five sisters and two brothers E_S ###and my mother has four brothers and two sisters . E_S ###So I ca- , N_S ###both of my parents had big families , E_S 
107250:4	###SpeakerA7 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###Just awful . E_S ###So I , N_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###Oh , and I know somebody that *T*-1 lives there , E_S ###and they never mentioned that problem . E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###Oh , \[ you 're kidding , \+ ###you 're kidding . \] E_S ###No , E_S ###it 's a d- , N_S ###well , maybe they did n't mention it because it 's just kind of a fact of life around here . E_S ###And , uh , N_S 
107462:68	###SpeakerA19 . ###\[ I 'm , \+ I 'm \] not sur- , N_S ###the only thing is 0 if they do n't vote , they have no right * to complain . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###Absolutely . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###It is , um , N_S ###I do n't know why we are so complacent *T*-1 , E_S ###but I 'm going *-1 to vote each time . E_S ###* Right or wrong I 'm going *-1 to cast a ballot E_S ###and then if I 'm unhappy with it , I have the right * to express my opinion . E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###That 's right . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###So , uh , there was something else 0 I was going *-1 to , N_S 
107960:14	###SpeakerB22 . ###\[ Today , \+ today \] \[ we , \+ we \] wear coats E_S ###and as the day , uh , warms up , we may go to light jackets , E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###Did you ? E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###but I do n't think 0 there 's an escape from light jackets . E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###I understand . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###The wind will take away a lot of body heat . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###Well , so are the people around you , um , dressing similar to you ? E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###Very similar . E_S 
108180:59	###SpeakerA29 . ###Yeah , E_S ###well , there was , N_S ###but there 's a sense of \[ ho- , \+ \] I guess *ICH*-1 , purity in the show , E_S ###like one of my favorite shows used *-1 to be HAPPY DAYS E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###Yes . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###but , uh , you know , Richie always used *-1 to be \[ so , \+ you know , just so \] honest and pure I guess 0 *T*-2 , E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###and when he left the show *T*-1 , you know , \[ that , \+ \] it seemed *-2 to be missing that part of it E_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
108956:29	###SpeakerA95 . ###Um , I did n't know that . E_S ###SpeakerB96 . ###Oh , yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA97 . ###Um . Well , I guess 0 the only comparison 0 I had ever heard *T*-1 was between \[ a , \+ a \] Christian college , because I thought about *-2 attending Abilene Christian instead of Texas Tech E_S ###SpeakerB98 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA99 . ###SpeakerB100 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA101 . ###and of course the price was just astronomical compared to Tech E_S ###SpeakerB102 . ###Um . E_S 
109022:42	###\[ they , \+ they \] no longer feel 0 \[ it 's , \+ uh , it *EXP*-1 's \] no big deal * \[ to , \+ to \] stay home and raise your family any more . E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###Well it has no credibility any more . E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###SpeakerB8 . ###SpeakerA9 . ###I know it , E_S ###and \[ \[ I , \+ I think , \] \+ I think \] 0 that 's really sad , because I think 0 there 's going *-2 to be a generation of kids that *T*-1 are going *-3 to grow up * raised *-4 by somebody else . E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###Well , I 'm a school teacher , E_S ###and I 'm in charge of * raising them , E_S ###so I can appreciate it . E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###You do n't , ###well , N_S 
109078:34	###SpeakerB30 . ###That 's true . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###uh , you know , to , N_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] do n't think 0 , you know , the kids do n't benefit from the bigger house and the fancier cars , \[ \[ and , \+ and , \] \+ and \] this type of thing . E_S ###I think that they would *?* from the , you know , attention or whatever E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###That 's true . E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###uh , but , it , N_S ###\[ \[ I , \+ uh , I , \] \+ I \] do n't know , E_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] see it as a major problem E_S ###and I think 0 it 's going *-1 to have *-2 to swing back the other way , because I think 0 we 're going *-3 to have an awful lot of kids who *T*-4 are going *-5 to have major problems from all this . E_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###Yeah , E_S 
109966:4	###SpeakerB48 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA49 . ###SpeakerB50 . ###Well , and I think 0 a lot of companies are realizing this and offering more opportunities as far as like job sharing or , you know , even having a day care on site and that kind of stuff , E_S ###and I think 0 that 's really important \[ that , \+ that \] they do that E_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB52 . ###and they realize 0 there 's a need for that , E_S ###and , um , I do n't know , E_S ###I found 0 when I did do some work *T*-1 when my son was young *T*-2 , it was like contract work , E_S ###and it was n't where I had *-1 to be there every day *T*-2 , E_S ###but , I mean , we were going to the doctor once a week , E_S ###so , I do n't know how you could have a full time job and ever have any vacation time 0 * to do anything besides * go to the doctor *T*-1 *T*-2 . E_S 
110375:10	###SpeakerA67 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB68 . ###and there was an incident in my children 's high school , where a teacher stayed drunk *T*-1 , E_S ###SpeakerA69 . ###Is that right ? E_S ###SpeakerB70 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA71 . ###You just do n't think of that happening with teachers E_S ###SpeakerB72 . ###And he , N_S ###SpeakerA73 . ###I really do n't , E_S ###when I think of drug testing *T*-1 , I 'm thinking of the , you know , outside of education . E_S 
110416:14	###same problems the same , uh , good qualities as anybody else . E_S ###SpeakerB86 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA87 . ###SpeakerB88 . ###Then , I think , you know , 0 \[ if \+ if \] \[ it came , \+ push came \] to shove , I 'd probably be drug tested *-1 you know , E_S ###SpeakerA89 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB90 . ###because it does , you know , N_S ###SpeakerA91 . ###\[ You , \+ you \] think 0 the benefit would be greater than the , N_S ###SpeakerB92 . ###Yeah , E_S 
110503:5	###SpeakerA18 . ###Yes , E_S ###uh , really sweet . E_S ###SpeakerB19 . ###Anyway , as far as clothing goes , um , my wardrobe changes all the time , depending on my size . E_S ###SpeakerA20 . ###That 's how I am *T*-1 too . E_S ###SpeakerB21 . ###We go from regular kind of spring clothes regular kind of fall clothes pregnant clothes , clothes that *T*-1 are in between where you 're not down to regular size yet or you 're on your way up from regular size *T*-2 E_S ###SpeakerA22 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB23 . ###SpeakerA24 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB25 . 
112537:4	###and they 're not quite big enough * to be getting into everything yet , E_S ###so . N_S ###SpeakerB64 . ###Not quite . E_S ###It 's a , N_S ###when they start *-2 to crawl *T*-3 they try *-1 to climb up on things E_S ###and N_S ###SpeakerA65 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###you have *-1 to be real careful 0 \[ all the , \+ everything \] is baby proof . E_S ###You know , all the doors have latches and stuff so they ca n't get into anything E_S ###but they try . E_S ###SpeakerA67 . ###Uh-huh . E_S 
113118:8	###SpeakerA24 . ###Yeah , E_S ###but , N_S ###SpeakerB25 . ###But I know a lot of people that *T*-1 get in trouble with them ###especially , you know N_S ###we have , N_S ###I 'm in Lubbock E_S ###and we have a bunch of college kids around here going to Tech , E_S ###and they seem *-1 to get in trouble with them a lot .

142183:4	###SpeakerB50 . ###Oh , yeah . E_S ###Well you can teach them .

142815:9	###We never MUMBLEx any more . E_S ###SpeakerA121 . ###Oh , I know . E_S ###But \[ it 's that , \+ it 's the \] textured wall .

143528:27	###SpeakerB80 . ###Oh , yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA81 . ###SpeakerB82 . ###Maybe that 's the case .

143651:11	###SpeakerB30 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###and , uh , both teachers and parents , uh , complain about \[ the , \+ uh , uh , the \] cost and ineffectiveness that *T*-1 results .

144108:14	###it 's a strange thing , E_S ###SpeakerA54 . ###Yeah .

147225:131	###SpeakerA50 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB51 . ###SpeakerA52 . ###Yeah .

148447:14	###\[ I , \+ I \] tell you , ###I do like , um , N_S ###I grew up on blue grass music . E_S ###My dad is a big blue grass fan , E_S ###and so N_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###Uh-huh .

E_S ###SpeakerB78 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA79 . ###But . N_S 
151506:23	###SpeakerA54 . ###SpeakerB55 . ###SpeakerA56 . ###You could time it just right . E_S ###SpeakerB57 . ###Yeah , E_S ###right , E_S ###right . E_S ###SpeakerA58 . ###I know one employee , E_S 0 I know , 0 when I was working with *T*-1 *T*-2 , *T*-1 he had alcohol on his breath , E_S ###and I 'm not sure if our policy covers that or not . E_S ###That 'd be just as dangerous . E_S ###SpeakerB59 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Well , especially around , uh , you know , equipment , machinery and stuff . E_S 
152498:93	###SpeakerB26 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###SpeakerB28 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###No doubt E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###But , N_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###Yeah , E_S ###and institutionally , like here at the university , oh if there is a cut back , well gee , it 's not \[ where it necessarily \+ where it 's needed *-1 *T*-2 , \] E_S ###it 's where it 's most expedient *T*-1 which , ###Well , in one sense for us , it 's where it makes the least noise *T*-1 which *T*-2 means 0 it 's often the lowest support type roles . E_S 
152729:176	###SpeakerA57 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB58 . ###SpeakerA59 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###SpeakerA61 . ###Oh , yeah , E_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] agree with it E_S ###yeah . E_S ###They will admit to you that they \[ can- , \+ do n't \] have the benefit of * being able \[ \[ *-2 to \+ you know , of , \] \+ of , \] *-3 \[ letting , \+ allowing \] themselves to believe their clients that *T*-1 are guilty E_S ###SpeakerB62 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA63 . ###it 's more of the game plan of how do they convince the judge or jury through argument *T*-1 . E_S 
152773:14	###SpeakerA3 . ###Right , E_S ###uh , where you live *T*-1 do you have a state income tax and a sales tax both ? E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###Oh , yes . E_S ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###Uh , uh-huh . E_S ###In New Hampshire we have , uh , uh , \[ no , \+ no , \] what we call *T*-1 broad base taxes . E_S ###No income tax and no sales tax . E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###Huh . E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###Uh , we tax business , uh , eight percent , E_S ###businesses are taxed *-1 eight percent E_S 
152788:4	###and we have what we call *T*-1 the five B s *ICH*-2 . Uh , \[ th- , \+ \] for our taxes .

E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###So , uh , we do have a very low tax rate , E_S ###but you know , combined with the federal income tax . I think that Americans generally do pay too much in taxes E_S ###and MUMBLEx . N_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###Right . E_S ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] agree E_S ###and I , MUMBLEx think 0 it 's about the time of the year when you just start *-1 getting , N_S 
152868:6	###so . I do n't know . E_S ###I 'm not really into politics , uh E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###That it , N_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###I do n't really understand it E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###but it 's just you know , N_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###Well , \[ it does it , \+ it does \] seem that the more taxes that *T*-1 are raised *-2 the more the politicians spend *T*-3 . E_S ###Uh , it 's almost like they will spend as much as \[ the , \+ \] they 're allowed *-1 to collect *?* . You know . E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###Right . E_S 
152992:142	###and I usually like go out an buy a newspaper if you know I 'm interested in any particular one . E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###Yeah . E_S ###The radio does n't really have much news sometimes . E_S ###The stations 0 I listen to *T*-1 are just mainly music . E_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I think 0 you pretty much have *-1 to listen to all news station * to get any news at all . E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Do you think that T V is , uh , pretty accurate . E_S ###I mean sometimes do you think 0 it gets pretty commercialized E_S ###or , N_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###Well , what I really do n't like *T*-1 about T V , especially local news as compared to like national news is just , uh , 0 \[ it seems , \+ it seems \] like everything is very spoon feed E_S 
153450:19	###SpeakerB30 . ###Um . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###Uh , you know , I mean , the problem though , you know , \[ they , if the , \+ since the \] United States had this , you know , pretty much unrestricted flow of guns going for so long that I think , you know , 0 if you were introduced , you know , any controls , it would probably take a long while for them to take effect just because there is a glut of guns out there already . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###You know , so \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] really kind of a complex problem . E_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###Well , is the crime that bad there in Atlanta ? E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###Uh , I 'm not really sure how bad it is *T*-1 . E_S ###\[ I 've , \+ I 've \] not really had that many problems with it , E_S ###but I mean apparently \[ we , \+ we \] were ranked *-1 pretty high up . E_S ###SpeakerB36 . 
153578:52	###SpeakerA83 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB84 . ###I would be scared *-1 selling guns to people . E_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###Okay . E_S ###So Frank , what , uh , type of , uh , budget do you or your family have *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###Well , uh I do n't know that we really have a budget . E_S ###I have a set amount \[ that I , \+ that I \] save *T*-1 . E_S ###\[ Actually , \+ well actually \] there is \[ a , \+ a \] way , N_S budget our money apparently . N_S ###The , N_S ###uh , my wife , uh , \[ has so much , \+ uh , gets so much \] 0 * to do shopping with *T*-1 every couple of weeks E_S ###and , uh , we allot each of us so much money per week for our personal stuff , gas , and things like that E_S ###and besides that \[ I , \+ uh , you know , I \] have a set amount that I save *T*-1 every month . E_S 
153672:9	###SpeakerA27 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###Uh , you know , we 've got two cars . E_S ###My wife has a car E_S ###and I like *-1 to drive pick up truck . E_S ###So , we are on a schedule where I try every , uh , three or four years *-1 \[ to , \+ to \] buy a new one *T*-2 . E_S ###And you know I am constantly making car payments , E_S ###but I figure 0 that 's got *-1 to be the story of my life anyway , is * making car payments . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###So , uh , you know , I get one paid for * E_S ###and , uh , actually I am saving up for another one besides E_S ###so \[ it 's \+ you know , it 's \] kind of a never ending thing , E_S 
154950:27	###SpeakerA35 . ###SpeakerB36 . ###SpeakerA37 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###Well , what do you do *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###Uh , I really do n't have a routine . E_S ###I like *-1 playing basketball . E_S ###We just bought a new home with a basketball hoop E_S ###and that 's what I do *T*-1 every day . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###Oh , great . E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###SpeakerB42 . 
155000:14	###and it 's because I exercise E_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###You do it , E_S ###SpeakerB54 . ###but I also watch what I eat *T*-1 . You know , E_S ###SpeakerA55 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB56 . ###but you 'll come , E_S ###*-1 being twenty-seven , you do n't really have *-1 to worry about your heart rate and that yet E_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###Yeah E_S ###and I N_S ###SpeakerB58 . ###but as you get older you will *?* . E_S 
157583:94	###SpeakerA47 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###And , so , if they penalize businesses , business people are smart enough *-1 to say , here 's *T*-2 my break point , ###I 'm not going *-3 to work any harder and make any more or create any more jobs . E_S ###SpeakerA49 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###SpeakerA51 . ###Exactly . E_S ###That 's , because until , like eight , N_S ###SpeakerB52 . ###And so , N_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###SpeakerB54 . 
157583:106	###SpeakerA47 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###And , so , if they penalize businesses , business people are smart enough *-1 to say , here 's *T*-2 my break point , ###I 'm not going *-3 to work any harder and make any more or create any more jobs . E_S ###SpeakerA49 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###SpeakerA51 . ###Exactly . E_S ###That 's , because until , like eight , N_S ###SpeakerB52 . ###And so , N_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###SpeakerB54 . 
157587:30	###I 'm not going *-3 to work any harder and make any more or create any more jobs . E_S ###SpeakerA49 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###SpeakerA51 . ###Exactly . E_S ###That 's , because until , like eight , N_S ###SpeakerB52 . ###And so , N_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###SpeakerB54 . ###Based on that , who do you think 0 you 're talking to *T*-1 , E_S ###you 're talking to an employer . E_S ###SpeakerA55 . ###SpeakerB56 . 
157662:116	###SpeakerB17 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA18 . ###and in fact , I 'm not sure that that 's any more , uh , liable *-1 to get rid *-2 of the reasonable doubt \[ than , \+ than \] anything else . E_S ###SpeakerB19 . ###Well , \[ the , \+ the \] one thing that I know 0 *T*-1 does seem *-2 to happen from people 0 I 've talked to *T*-3 on this , is that in the situation 0 you just said *T*-4 where it 's nine to three , or some such number *T*-5 , \[ that there 's , an effect 0 *T*-7 starts *-8 being \+ that there 's starts *-6 being \] a lot of peer pressure going on E_S ###SpeakerA20 . ###Uh-huh .

E_S ###SpeakerA22 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I 'd read one book , I think 0 it was calls *-1 TRIAL BY JURY of all things , that , uh *T*-2 went through and interviewed a bunch of jurors in some of the big cases , and in many cases *-3 looking \[ at what *T*-4 had , \+ \] at the evidence afterwards as to whether the decision was right , went back to the jurors , uh , based on the deliberations . E_S ###SpeakerB23 . 
157673:106	###SpeakerA22 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I 'd read one book , I think 0 it was calls *-1 TRIAL BY JURY of all things , that , uh *T*-2 went through and interviewed a bunch of jurors in some of the big cases , and in many cases *-3 looking \[ at what *T*-4 had , \+ \] at the evidence afterwards as to whether the decision was right , went back to the jurors , uh , based on the deliberations . E_S ###SpeakerB23 . ###Uh , E_S ###SpeakerA24 . ###SpeakerB25 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA26 . ###Some of them did say that , you know , when they were the only one left * opposing the verdict *T*-1 , uh , you know , everyone was getting on them \[ so , \+ so \] heavily that eventually they just gave in *-4 knowing that nothing 0 they could do *T*-2 could stop it from * either being the verdict 0 everyone else was trying for *T*-3 or a hung jury because the one vote does n't mean anything except the ability * to not have a verdict . E_S ###SpeakerB27 . ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] understand . E_S ###\[ You , \+ you \] would hope that if you were in that situation that you 'd have the moral fortitude , uh , * to hold out if you believed that that was really the proper response . E_S ###I think of the movie , uh , TWELVE ANGRY MEN . E_S 
158267:12	###but , I mean , if it was really a deterrent , I mean I think like 0 horse thieves in the old west , you know , N_S they saw other horse thieves hanging by the necks every once in a while . E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###And \[ if we really w- , \+ if it was really \] seriously going *-1 to be a \[ d- , \+ deterrent , \] I would think that it would be public . E_S ###I mean I do n't think 0 it would be this private thing because \[ nobody ever , \+ nobody ever \] sees it . E_S ###If someone ever , N_S ###if , you know , N_S ###like * say 0 some young kids or something like that that *T*-1 might be inclined more towards a life of crime , had *-2 to sit and watch \[ and , \+ and \] see a guy burn \[ or , \+ or , \] you know , something or shot *-3 by a firing squad or something like that . E_S ###I would think 0 you 'd make a bigger impact on their life rather than , you know , *-1 telling them that \[ there 's , \+ there 's \] protestors out here at the , you know . N_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###Well , \[ I , \+ I \] do n't know if that would really work that way or not . E_S ###Uh , there 's a lot of violence , E_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###Well , anyway \[ I , \+ uh , I , \] uh , oh , N_S 
159568:6	###SpeakerB53 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###And , you know , there 's a \[ lot of , \+ number of \] N_S ###the elderly are very , you know , complaining because they remember the way that things used *-3 to be *T*-1 .

E_S ###And \[ they feel \+ they feel \] pretty helpless . E_S ###SpeakerB57 . ###And it *EXP*-1 , very , very hard for them to accept that . E_S ###SpeakerA58 . ###SpeakerB59 . ###We just , uh , moved my grandfather into , not a nursing home but , you know , a transitional type facility . E_S 
160030:4	###it 's like fifteen hundred dollars , E_S ###but if you go for the other ones you 're paying too much money for them because \[ it 's unlikely , \+ if you 're \[ f- , \+ relatively , \] uh , healthy , then it 's really unlikely \] that you 'd use that \[ much , \+ amount \] of money , you know . E_S ###So , \[ \[ the- , \+ \] it , \+ you know , someone \] did start a cost benefit analysis , E_S ###and * ends up 0 the best is * to take a high deductible \[ and , \+ and \] take a loss , \[ what- , \+ whatever \] it happens *-1 to be *T*-2 , if you happen *-3 to be a healthy individual . E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I guess , E_S ###uh , on the other hand , you know , \[ I , \+ I \] \[ had a similar , \+ had a similar \] health plan E_S ###and , uh , one of my kids was in a car accident E_S ###and , uh I \[ had , \+ wound up *-2 having \] *-3 to pay for , you know , a bunch of doctor visits and stuff out of my pocket because \[ of , \+ \] you know , \[ no , \+ no \] insurance policy happened *-1 to cover it , which *T*-4 is , N_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###Um . E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###SpeakerA25 . ###Really ? E_S 
160079:53	###\[ and , \+ and \] they , N_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###Uh , with the telecommunications type of company , supposedly you , used *-1 to be much more stable . E_S ###It 's a lot less stable than it used *-1 to be *?* . E_S ###They used *-1 to have job security crap , E_S ###but now they do n't . E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###So you work for Bell or something like that ? E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###Yeah , E_S ###it 's the Bell Corps , which *T*-1 is , uh , N_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###Yeah . E_S 
160996:46	###and they 're not contributing taxes . E_S ###SpeakerB76 . ###That 's right . E_S ###SpeakerA77 . ###So , you know , \[ it 's , \+ it *EXP*-1 's \] very hard * to say , you know , this is what we should cut *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerB78 . ###Yeah , E_S ###it 's really , N_S ###that is the , N_S ###especially \[ that defense , \+ cuts in the defense \] is really a Catch twenty-two double whammy , because like you say , if you cut defense , well , that 's great , E_S ###SpeakerA79 . ###MUMBLEx . ###SpeakerB80 . ###that 's going *-1 to lower our national expenditures , E_S ###but then you 're going *-1 to have people on welfare E_S 
161302:17	###SpeakerB114 . ###Oh , did it attack the child , then ? E_S ###SpeakerA115 . ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ it , \+ it \] bit him . E_S ###SpeakerB116 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA117 . ###And \[ that was , \+ that was \] not a good thing , E_S ###but I think 0 it was probably \[ a , \+ an \] individual ferret thing , because \[ it was f- , \+ it was a fairly \] wild ferret . E_S ###SpeakerB118 . ###Well , \[ the \+ the \] people that *T*-1 owned him should have been on the lookout for that . E_S ###SpeakerA119 . ###\[ Had n't , \+ they had n't , \] N_S ###SpeakerB120 . 
161493:18	###SpeakerB26 . ###SpeakerA27 . ###That 's good . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###I think 0 it is *?* . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###I 'm impressed . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###Uh , for a while there , \[ music seemed * to really ha- , \+ popular music seemed *-1 to have , \] uh , not a lot of point to it . E_S ###I was really tired of , uh , the Michael Bolton .

E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###SpeakerB34 . 
162080:24	###\[ and , \+ and \] \[ I 'm , \+ I 'm \] thinking that it 's even to the point that the people \[ in , \+ \] that *T*-1 run the system have given up on it *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerB54 . ###Uh , well , \[ I , \+ I \] think 0 the people \[ that *T*-2 run , \+ yeah , that *T*-1 run \] the system are the most hardened and probably the most cynical , you know . E_S ###SpeakerA55 . ###Uh . E_S ###SpeakerB56 . ###I mean , \[ \[ I , \+ uh , you know , I , \] \+ I \] talked to a few people who *T*-1 worked in prisons and stuff E_S ###and it 's , uh , N_S ###you can get pretty hardened , I 'm sure 0 *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###But * getting , I mean , ###well , see , N_S I always have problems \[ because , \+ because \] I can never decide whether or not \[ I 'm , \+ I 'm \] supposed *-1 to be a conservative \[ or , \+ or \] a liberal E_S ###but , N_S ###SpeakerB58 . ###Yeah , E_S 
163180:4	###They 're real difficult 0 * to catch *T*-1 , E_S ###and if they do catch them , they do n't get any monetary gain out of it , whereas \[ us , \+ we \] write a check .

E_S ###You d- , N_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###They target their efforts toward the citizens not the criminals . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###Well , How would you go about *-2 changing it *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###SpeakerA21 . 
163741:22	###SpeakerB34 . ###And spare the economy . E_S ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ it 's really , \+ it 's \] a hard balance . ###\[ It , \+ it \] definitely is *?* .

163908:64	###SpeakerA57 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB58 . ###but , N_S ###SpeakerA59 . ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ \[ i- , \+ i- , \] \+ it 's \] the artist , not the merit .

E_S ###SpeakerA61 . ###Yeah . E_S 
164098:95	###SpeakerB38 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###it could still happen then .

E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###Sure . E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###SpeakerB34 . ###Is , uh , traction much of an issue for you up there . E_S ###SpeakerA35 . 
164292:110	###and even though * just using is not really , N_S ###I mean it is a crime , E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###Oh , well , yeah , E_S ###\[ \[ that , \+ that , \] \+ that \] is a crime .

E_S ###\[ They , \+ they \] just , N_S ###matter of fact , \[ that , \+ that \] reminded me of an article 0 I saw *T*-1 in the pa- , N_S ###the local schools , you could send your phone book \[ to your , \+ uh , \[ to , \+ with \] your \] kid to school E_S ###and what they 'll do *T*-1 is they 'll recycle it . E_S ###Because there was an article or a story done * awhile ago that , uh , \[ trash , \+ uh , the telephone books \] are the type of thing that *T*-1 do n't break down over a long period of time . E_S ###A guy went to \[ a d- , \+ a landfill , \] dug down five feet \[ and , \+ and \] pulled up a phone book from like nineteen sixty E_S ###because \[ they do n't , \+ they do n't \] degrade over such a period of time . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###Well , part of the problem with * recycling them in the past has been 0 the covers are made *-1 with a clay based paper . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###They contain the glue and stuff E_S 
166108:36	###\[ They , \+ they \] did more things together . E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###Uh , they ate dinner at the table together . E_S ###Uh , the parents usually took out \[ time , \+ uh , you know , more time \] than they do now *-1 to come with the children and just spend the day *-2 doing a family activity . E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###Uh , although I 'm not a mother , \[ I , \+ I \] still think that , uh , a lot has changed since ten years ago . E_S ###Uh , what do you think *T*-1 about that ? E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###We , N_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###SpeakerA9 . 
166168:85	###SpeakerB28 . ###Huh . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###SpeakerB30 . ###Yes . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###SpeakerB32 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###And now , uh , it *EXP*-1 's pretty much an economic necessity \[ \[ of , \+ for most , \] \+ in most \] places for both parents to work . E_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###Do you think 0 it 's an economic \[ c- , \+ necessity \] E_S ###or do you think that \[ we 're , \+ we 're , \] uh , all trying *-1 to keep up with a certain standard of living ? E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###I think 0 that 's part of it too . E_S 
166244:11	###SpeakerA65 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###and not all of those are necessities . E_S ###SpeakerA67 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB68 . ###So they 're trying *-1 to , N_S ###it has become a necessity . E_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###SpeakerB2 . ###Uh , well , * \[ h- , \+ having \] N_S ###sort of the reason 0 we 're going through the school system *T*-1 N_S ###I seem *-1 to be younger than most people \[ who , \+ who \] *T*-2 talk on this thing . E_S ###\[ I 'm , \+ I 'm \] just \[ graduating col- , \+ graduating from college . \] E_S 
167132:4	###why should an individual \[ just because it 's , \+ just because the state \] ca n't really find out about it , be able *-1 to avoid *-2 paying sales tax *T*-3 ? E_S ###SpeakerB5 . ###Well , I mean , it seems to me that , generally , at least in my own experience , when I purchase something mail order *T*-2 , it 's not * to circumvent *-1 paying sales tax to the State of Pennsylvania . E_S ###It 's because , I 'm sorry , the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania . N_S ###SpeakerA6 . ###Yes . E_S ###SpeakerB7 . ###Uh , it 's because \[ I , \+ I \] ca n't find the item that I want *T*-1 at a competitive price anywhere in my local area . E_S ###So I go outside the area for that . E_S ###And I think that it *EXP*-3 's not my responsibility * to police myself and pay Pennsylvania what they believe 0 they are owed *-1 *T*-2 even though , you know , the revenue stream went to another state . E_S ###\[ I do n't , \+ I do n't \] think that that 's my responsibility \[ as a , \+ as a \] conscientious consumer . E_S ###SpeakerA8 . ###\[ I , \+ I 'll \] agree 0 \[ it , \+ it 's \] not your responsibility E_S ###\[ but , \+ b- , \] is it *EXP*-1 also legal , for you to do that ? E_S ###SpeakerB9 . 
167158:22	###SpeakerB13 . ###Right . E_S ###But 0 the point is *T*-1 is that businesses do that . E_S ###The business that you purchase the thing from *T*-1 is responsible for * collecting the appropriate sales tax and forwarding it to the state in question . E_S ###That 's a cost of * doing business . E_S ###The burden should n't be placed *-1 on the consumer . E_S ###SpeakerA14 . ###And \[ \[ I , \+ I \] \+ I \] was actually talking about businesses purchasing something mail order and then \[ having , \+ having \] *-1 to pay sales tax on it .

E_S ###SpeakerA15 . 
169216:21	###SpeakerA33 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###SpeakerA35 . ###Well , you know , uh , also I 've heard that , uh , the newest thing is 0 a lot of people are specializing in *-1 robbing people during the time 0 they 're home *T*-2 .

E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###A high percentage of , uh , free time , N_S ###I think 0 it 's like fifty percent of most people 's free time is , uh , spent *T*-1 * doing yard work outdoors .

169466:54	###So , I mean , I 'm not being elitist in that sense , I hope 0 *T*-1 .

170113:100	###Uh , so maybe we should start with you . E_S ###What do you do *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###About the same thing . E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###Really ? E_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###Oh . E_S ###Maybe they 're going *-1 to arrest us both . E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###I 'm even in worse shape because I have eight children E_S ###and , uh , we live from hand to mouth . E_S ###We hope that there 's enough money *ICH*-1 at the end of the month * to pay for the bills 
170486:9	###SpeakerB27 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA28 . ###But , uh , yeah , E_S ###\[ it , \+ it 's \] a little bit difficult , though .

170600:9	###I do n't know how it is *T*-1 in Georgia E_S ###SpeakerB63 . ###Huh . E_S ###SpeakerA64 . ###and I do n't think 0 our part of the country is particularly bad compared to some .

E_S ###\[ Ha- , \+ we have \] a lot of people moving here from Boston \[ and , \+ and \] different areas E_S ###and from * talking to them , they 're shocked *-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA68 . ###Really ? E_S 
170889:6	###SpeakerB26 . ###Right , E_S ###right . E_S ###That 's what my grandparents , N_S ###it was just so that the rest of the relatives would have peace of mind *-1 knowing that if anything happened , there was somebody there for them . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###So that was their thinking . E_S ###Somebody who *T*-1 would know what * to do *T*-2 in the event of an emergency . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###And also so they could find someplace that they enjoyed *T*-1 while they still had choices 0 * to make *T*-2 . So they would n't be stuck *-3 going into just whatever nursing home *T*-4 was available at the time . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . 
170943:4	###And , with medicine being the way 0 it is *T*-1 , you 're extending life where sometimes the quality of living has gone down *T*-2 E_S ###and they 're not necessarily enjoying life anymore . E_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Well maybe that 's the purpose of the nursing home is * to have them go someplace where they can see that it 's not worth * continuing *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###It *EXP*-3 's just a shame 0 that 's the way 0 it has *-1 to be *T*-4 . E_S ###I think 0 the retirement home idea 's a nice idea . ###* To go and find older people and with similar interests and someplace 0 * to stay *T*-1 E_S ###SpeakerA49 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###and cause like if your spouse died , MUMBLEx all alone , it *EXP*-1 'd be nice * to go someplace with people similar to you . To have friends . E_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###Right . E_S 
171285:14	###SpeakerA55 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Yeah . E_S ###That 's kind of scary . E_S ###Huh . Well that 's true . E_S ###But , I , N_S ###it 's just \[ very , \+ very \] different E_S ###and I guess 0 every ten years it 's just been very different . E_S ###SpeakerB56 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###So . And I do n't know what *T*-1 's going *-2 to happen . E_S ###Uh , I know 0 what I 'm seeing *T*-1 here at \[ m- , \+ my \] job is that people are having their children much later in life so that they 're establishing careers E_S ###SpeakerB58 . ###Yeah , E_S 
171298:69	###SpeakerB58 . ###Yeah , E_S ###tha- , N_S ###SpeakerA59 . ###and they 've got their homes E_S ###and they 've got , N_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###Why do n't you go ahead and start *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###Okay . E_S ###Well I think 0 the court systems could stand some improvement . E_S ###Uh , trial by jury is good E_S ###but \[ a lot of time i- , \+ a lot of cases , \] uh , * is circumstantial evidence \[ that , \+ that \] *T*-1 convicts a person , which I do n't think 0 *T*-2 is all the time good .

E_S ###And how can you convict somebody on circumstantial evidence *T*-1 is beyond me . E_S ###I do n't know . E_S 
171355:46	###SpeakerB16 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###I think 0 maybe \[ th- , \+ a \] judge is a better judge of that E_S ###or , uh , N_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###Well , \[ s- , \+ sometimes \] the sentencing \[ is still , \+ is not \] fair . E_S ###I mean even if , well the jury , I guess 0 they do decide that E_S ###\[ but , \+ but , \] I 'm like you , E_S ###in a case like that , most of the time its , N_S ###I do n't know , E_S ###maybe I 'm \[ too , \+ too , \] uh , uh , conservative when it comes to that *T*-1 . E_S ###\[ Th- , \+ the \] sentencing is really light compared to what I think 0 they should be *T*-1 in a lot of cases you know , ###uh , E_S ###SpeakerA19 . 
171383:15	###SpeakerB26 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###Uh , it 's kind of , uh , uh , a hanging jury atmosphere . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###But in a lot of places , I think 0 people bend over the other way , E_S ###but \[ I guess , \+ I guess \] 0 I like the system that they have *T*-1 in some places where the defendant \[ gets *-3 to choose whether he 's , \+ goes before a jury for sentencing or whether the judge gets *T*-2 to choose \] it *T*-4 . E_S ###\[ Some , \+ some \] cases in some jurisdictions , they can do that . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###Oh really ? E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###I kind of like that system . E_S ###Yeah . E_S 
171391:33	###but \[ I guess , \+ I guess \] 0 I like the system that they have *T*-1 in some places where the defendant \[ gets *-3 to choose whether he 's , \+ goes before a jury for sentencing or whether the judge gets *T*-2 to choose \] it *T*-4 .

E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###Yeah . E_S ###\[ That 's , \+ that 's \] not a bad system . E_S ###But \[ I , \+ I \] do think 0 it needs *-1 to be shaken *-2 up a little bit . E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###But , the thing is too , 0 maybe they need \[ more of a , \+ I do n't know , more of a \] expert types \[ to , \+ to \] be on some of these jury cases because most time you just pick , you know , Joe Blow or whoever and a good citizen or whoever \[ an- , \+ and \] call them in . E_S 
171414:6	###SpeakerB40 . ###MUMBLEx ###exactly . E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###I would like *-1 to see most civil cases tried *-2 before a panel of experts instead of ordinary juries . E_S ###SpeakerB42 . ###Right , E_S ###exactly . E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###Insurance cases and things like that . E_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###Yeah .

E_S 
171556:16	###Service is more of a problem .
