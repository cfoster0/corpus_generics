276:7	###Is it , N_S ###how close is it *T*-1 to a home environment . E_S ###SpeakerB114 . ###Yes . E_S ###That 's right . E_S ###SpeakerA115 . ###\[ That 's the , \+ that 's probably the \] major question . E_S ###SpeakerB116 . ###I think that great strides *ICH*-2 are being made *-1 nowadays \[ in , \+ in \] * caring for the elderly , you know , \[ \[ in several , \+ in a , \] \+ in a \] whole lot of areas . E_S ###SpeakerA117 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB118 . ###SpeakerA119 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB120 . 
733:34	###Is , uh , N_S ###do you know who he is *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerB42 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Somebody in South Carolina told me about him . E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###He 's \[ a , \+ the \] movie critic . E_S ###Um , oh , you 've , oh , N_S ###okay . E_S ###He 's a movie critic on channel eight in Dallas . E_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###Yeah .

1057:6	###so , maybe that is \[ a , \+ a \] little bit of what privacy is *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA69 . ###Yes . E_S ###Exactly . E_S ###SpeakerB70 . ###SpeakerA71 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###I also thought about it , \[ was of , \+ \] uh , *-1 waiting *-2 to talk to you that , another thing that *T*-4 occurred to me is 0 there is not so much invasion of my privacy because I know how *-5 to behave *T*-6 such that there is n't *?* . E_S ###But I realized 0 I have *-1 to behave in a certain way in order *-2 to not have people invade my privacy . E_S ###If I deviate from social norms of behavior , if I run up and down the street *-1 yelling or something , someone 's going *-2 to invade my privacy very quickly . E_S ###SpeakerB72 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA73 . ###And I realize \[ that \+ that , \] I mean , I can take that for granted E_S ###but \[ I used *-1 to , \+ I used *-2 to \] live in India E_S 
1074:14	###In fact , it *EXP*-2 's said *-1 that no Indian language has a word for privacy , E_S ###certainly the language 0 I know *T*-1 does n't , but just says a word for loneliness . E_S ###SpeakerB74 . ###Oh , that 's interesting . E_S ###SpeakerA75 . ###Loneliness *ICH*-2 is the closest 0 you can come *T*-1 , which *T*-3 is really quite different . E_S ###SpeakerB76 . ###\[ But , \+ but \] no concept for * wanting *-1 to be private . E_S ###SpeakerA77 . ###Yeah . E_S ###\[ It 's , \+ it 's \] generally 0 * being alone is not a very desirable state , at least officially . E_S ###SpeakerB78 . ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerA79 . ###Um , so there 's not , N_S 
1075:4	###certainly the language 0 I know *T*-1 does n't , but just says a word for loneliness . E_S ###SpeakerB74 . ###Oh , that 's interesting .

E_S ###SpeakerA79 . ###Um , so there 's not , N_S ###I mean , doors do n't have latches on them . E_S 
1096:9	###Oh . E_S ###\[ \[ That , \+ that \] would be , \+ That would be \] culturally shocking . E_S ###SpeakerA81 . ###SpeakerB82 . ###SpeakerA83 . ###You know , it very much is *?* . E_S ###But on the other hand , I realized 0 I could go out on the street and act like a complete lunatic , E_S ###SpeakerB84 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA85 . ###and people would leave , me alone . E_S ###SpeakerB86 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA87 . ###Whereas in this country where everyone respects the closed doors very much *T*-1 , if you go out and then act like the lunatic \[ you , \+ you \] violate \[ the , \+ uh , the \] norms \[ of social , \+ of , um , public \] behavior . E_S 
1112:45	###and they start *-1 asking questions and in the sense are \[ \[ invite- , \+ invade , \] \+ invading \] your privacy although , if you know what the social norms are *T*-2 , you know , quote unquote , you asked for it .

E_S ###SpeakerA89 . ###\[ And \+ \] which *T*-1 is n't \[ of , \+ \] always the case in all cultures , E_S ###and it was n't until I was thinking about it just now that I realized 0 that 's actually something that *T*-1 's culturally relative . E_S ###SpeakerB90 . ###\[ Tha- , \+ that \] is true .

E_S ###SpeakerA91 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###uh-huh . E_S ###And that 's really , um , N_S 
1131:42	###you go to India E_S ###and \[ it 's obvious , \+ you know , the results of sex are quite obvious , \] , as the population goes up an extra hundred million every few years . E_S ###Um , but \[ I , \+ I \] just do n't quite , um , N_S ###there 's hope , ###I actually ###for al- , N_S of the time 0 I 've spent *T*-1 there , I still do n't quite understand how certain things that I assume 0 *T*-2 and require privacy and require not just that you be alone but actually that you have a sense of privacy *T*-3 . E_S ###SpeakerB94 . ###Yes . E_S ###SpeakerA95 . ###Because anyone can be alone for some period of time E_S ###but for me a lot of what I do *T*-1 requires a sense that there 's this invisible barrier around me which people \[ wil- , \+ will \] respect *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerB96 . ###Yes . E_S ###SpeakerA97 . ###And if that 's gone , um , \[ I , \+ I \] really do n't know how *-1 to live *T*-2 very well , E_S 
1415:7	###and you stay there . E_S ###And I feel like the next generation , you 'll probably just work right along with your husband , you know . E_S ###SpeakerB25 . ###Yeah , E_S ###uh-huh , E_S ###I think 0 it 's definitely gotten better . E_S ###SpeakerA26 . ###Oh , I do to , ###much . E_S ###And it 's just going *-1 to get better . E_S ###SpeakerB27 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA28 . ###It really is *?* . E_S ###SpeakerB29 . 
1421:92	###SpeakerA26 . ###Oh , I do to , ###much . E_S ###And it 's just going *-1 to get better . E_S ###SpeakerB27 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA28 . ###It really is *?* . E_S ###SpeakerB29 . ###Because women are in every field now , E_S ###I mean I ca n't think of a field that they 're not involved in *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerA30 . ###Oh , I ca n't either , ###not a one . E_S ###SpeakerB31 . 
1585:22	###oh , no , E_S ###I think , N_S ###yeah . E_S ###My son 's just in day-care E_S ###but even that they have extracurricular activities E_S ###and * the older 0 they get *T*-1 the more that you 're involved in that . E_S ###SpeakerA88 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###I think 0 it 's great , E_S ###I really , N_S ###SpeakerB89 . ###Yeah , E_S ###SpeakerA90 . ###and I look for more of that in the next generation . E_S ###SpeakerB91 . 
1640:14	###But I know , N_S ###SpeakerA104 . ###Yeah , E_S ###but I can \[ rem- , \+ remember \] 0 back * growing up , my mother , N_S ###I mean it was N_S ###she always worked , E_S ###but it *EXP*-1 was n't that easy for her to just take off . E_S ###SpeakerB105 . ###Oh no , E_S ###I can remember my mother getting in trouble if , you know , one of was sick , E_S ###and I know 0 she probably did n't make hardly anything , you know , compared to the work that she did *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA106 . ###Oh yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB107 . ###I think 0 there is still some discrimination there where \[ as , \+ \] you know , men and women work in the same job *T*-1 , E_S 
2613:4	###Well I think 0 T I 's dress code is pretty lax * considering everything , anyway , you know , uh . E_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###\[ I know , \+ I did n't know \] that E D S has a very strict dress code , E_S ###I had a friend , E_S ###SpeakerA49 . ###Oh do they really ?

E_S ###SpeakerB52 . ###Oh , it is definitely lined *-1 out . E_S

E_S ###SpeakerB84 . ###and sometimes he wears the jacket to it . E_S ###SpeakerA85 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB86 . ###And some of the patent attorneys have been real casual in their clothes E_S 
3692:182	###it makes it a little bit easier , I think , that way . E_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###Yeah , E_S ###it does , E_S ###\[ an , \+ an \] then , uh , you know , my husband enjoys *-1 spending time with the kids , you know , E_S ###\[ he 'll , \+ he 'll \] take them out just *-1 to be with them . E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###So \[ he , \+ they \] can have time with him \[ an . \+ \] E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###So you have a break too .

3832:6	###or they think 0 it *EXP*-2 's wonderful just *-1 to go to McDonald 's , you know , E_S ###they do n't go for the food E_S ###they go for \[ the , \+ \] *-1 to play around E_S ###and , There 's another place in Mesquite called * Monkey Business , E_S ###SpeakerA59 . ###That 's right .

4492:112	###And , uh , oh \[ \[ the , \+ the , \] \+ the \] \[ uni- , \+ University \] of California at Berkeley puts out THE WELLNESS LETTER .

7517:49	###I think 0 in , uh , the Texas governor elections , I think more people turned out *-1 to vote against somebody than for somebody , this time . E_S ###SpeakerB23 . ###Yeah , E_S ###well , that , uh , N_S ###MUMBLEx I know that there 's certain issues that *T*-1 can really motivate people because we live in a \[ \[ pr- , \+ pr- , \] \+ predominately \] Catholic type area , E_S ###SpeakerA24 . ###Oh , really ?

E_S ###SpeakerA61 . 
9833:36	###SpeakerB110 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA111 . ###And the shows that I like *T*-1 now , they would n't let me watch *T*-2 . E_S ###I had *-1 to catch them all on repeats .

E_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###Oh , I can imagine , E_S ###what did he shoot him with *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB52 . ###Uh , well , uh , from what we can tell *T*-1 it was a pellet gun E_S ###and then he started *-1 chasing him with a bull whip . E_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###Oh my gosh . E_S

11134:8	###and I started *-1 doing that at work .

E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###and that 's really helped a lot , E_S ###I mean , everybody 's pitched in E_S ###and , you know , it *EXP*-1 does n't bother them * to walk little bit farther put their aluminum in a can rather than *-2 just throwing it in their trash can . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###SpeakerA31 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###So , \[ I really , \+ I really \] like that , E_S 
11872:4	###Um , E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###Um , there does n't seem *-1 to be much emission from them , E_S ###but I 'm not sure about the rest of the country . E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I notice 0 locally a major problem is Kodak . E_S ###Um , it 's interesting E_S ###because in order *-4 to , uh , keep with the E P A standards \[ which , \+ which \] *T*-1 tend *-2 to be visible , uh , what *T*-3 's coming out of your smokestack , they do all their emissions at night . E_S ###Uh , so people get up , N_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###Okay , E_S ###well , is that right ? . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###Yeah , E_S 
13191:25	###Uh , and , you know , I mean , there have been so many people that *T*-1 have done it E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###MUMBLEx . ###SpeakerB4 . ###and I 've talked with several E_S ###and I think 0 they 've gotten a lot out of it . E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###Well , are you doing any kind of volunteer work now ?

13453:10	###but I find that very annoying . The , uh , mail stuff , E_S ###SpeakerB56 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###yeah , ###you know , E_S it 's kind of irritating , E_S ###but it 's not nearly as obnoxious as the phone calls . E_S ###SpeakerB58 . ###\[ I think , \+ I think \] 0 you mentioning the phone calls during dinner , E_S ###SpeakerA59 . ###SpeakerB60 . ###I know 0 when I sit down with the family and want *-1 to have the opportunity , \[ you know , \+ \] * to talk and see what *T*-2 's going on and all those things *T*-3 , E_S ###SpeakerA61 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB62 . 
13490:38	###SpeakerB74 . ###\[ but , \+ So \] \[ tho- , \+ I guess 0 those \] three things are the , uh , uh , most irritating to me . E_S ###SpeakerA75 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB76 . ###SpeakerA77 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###I agree with the phone , too , in that , ###I 'm single , E_S ###but when I come home from work *T*-1 , there 's times 0 I need *-2 to pay bills *T*-3 , E_S ###I need *-1 to balance my checking account , E_S ###I need *-1 to do all kinds of different things like that , E_S ###and even though it 's friends calling , sometimes you just feel like , this is my quiet time , E_S ###I need *-1 to get things done *-2 E_S ###and the phone ringing bothers me , E_S 
13926:14	###Uh , uh , what I 'm thinking about *T*-1 is 0 back , well , when I was a kid *T*-2 , and much earlier than that , kids were kind of , \[ i- , \+ i- , \] N_S you know , ###the parents kind of pushed them to join , like the Boy Scouts or Girl Scouts E_S ###and they did , \[ \[ do , \+ do \] \+ do \] a lot of public service activities , E_S ###but these days they 're not , uh , E_S ###\[ par- , \+ parents \] are n't encouraging their kids to do things like that . E_S ###Because when I was in the Girl Scouts *T*-1 , we did a lot of public service things , because that 's just part \[ \[ o- , \+ of , \] \+ of \] the scouting , and , you know . N_S ###SpeakerA12 . ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ I 've , \+ I 've , \] N_S ###that 's really great . E_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] really think that both the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts is \[ a excellent , \+ two excellent \] organizations .

14725:84	###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###And , uh , somebody walks in there with a gun . E_S ###I mean , they 're going *-1 to want the money , E_S ###and you can tell by the people who *T*-1 are always caught *-2 , that these people are there *-3 to get money for drugs . E_S ###I mean , they do n't want the money \[ so , \+ uh , so \] they can do something else with it . E_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###No , E_S ###they do n't want the money for food , E_S ###that 's for sure . E_S ###SpeakerA49 . ###Right , E_S ###right , E_S ###and so . N_S ###SpeakerB50 . 
15223:64	###SpeakerB62 . ###Yeah , E_S ###m- , N_S ###SpeakerA63 . ###and the Peace Corps or something like that is probably useful \[ as , \+ as \] that kind of a time . E_S ###SpeakerB64 . ###Yeah , E_S ###maybe a little bit in that perspective , E_S ###\[ but , \+ uh , and \] a lot of people have gone in the military , I mean , you know , when they 're in the college *T*-1 . E_S ###Sometimes it 's * to \[ sup- , \+ help *-1 support \] college , you know , the money . E_S ###SpeakerA65 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###Uh , \[ others , \+ people \] do n't know what they want *-1 to do *T*-2 . E_S ###But as far as , uh , you know , the Peace Corps .

16147:39	###\[ I wo n't make , \+ I wo n't have \] a sharp cheddar because \[ it , \+ for fondue I think 0 it \] should be a little calmer than real sharp , cheddar . E_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###Right .

E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###\[ It- , \+ \] see you do n't necessarily have *-1 to dip this stuff . E_S ###And , um , I was going *-1 to have broccoli and cauliflower for \[ a , \+ a \] vegetable . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###That 's always a good thing . E_S

18074:27	###But it 's , N_S ###SpeakerB62 . ###SpeakerA63 . ###\[ I , \+ I \] know .

19028:42	###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###because , you know , I 've talked to many people E_S ###and we would n't mind *-1 going its extra effort *-2 to do it . ###Uh , E_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###If they make it so that it 's not a horrendous inconvenience , I think 0 most people would *?* .

19933:17	###SpeakerA115 . ###Yeah .

22387:13	###they 're very bold it seems 0 *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB100 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###very much . E_S ###When we moved here to Monterrey *T*-1 it was a big change , because it 's such a small community , E_S ###we 're just above Carmel , E_S ###and , um , there 's hardly , N_S ###most everybody seems pretty well employed around here , E_S ###and um , those that *T*-1 are n't , N_S ###there 's Celinas which *T*-1 is about a fifteen minute drive , which *T*-2 is mostly migrant workers , E_S ###and there 's a lot of crime there , um , ###migrant Hispanic farm workers , people that *T*-1 are down and out , E_S ###and uh , they all seem *-1 to congregate in Celinas , not so much here in Monterrey .

23379:12	###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA93 . ###You know , if we go out and pick up a bunch of cans from people , sure they 'll save them for us , ###there 's no problem there . E_S ###SpeakerB94 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA95 . ###But what do you do *T*-1 with them in the meantime ? E_S ###SpeakerB96 . ###That 's right . E_S ###SpeakerA97 . ###Now I do n't want \[ a can , \+ a garage \] full of cans . E_S ###SpeakerB98 . ###That 's right , E_S ###who *T*-1 does . E_S

26250:64	###SpeakerA141 . ###Yeah . E_S ###I 've got a nice little business at home , E_S ###and I sit around and tinker with that most of the time .

29004:31	###it was , this way we did n't have *-1 to layoff an active person E_S ###and we 'd just let you go .

29611:4	###SpeakerB6 . ###Uh-huh .

32788:6	###SpeakerB282 . ###Oh , \[ they , \+ they \] are the best . E_S ###SpeakerA283 . ###Yeah .

36222:36	###Well I bet you 0 there 's a whole bunch of homeless people up there who *T*-1 would take that job for thirteen thousand dollars a year . E_S ###SpeakerB156 . ###Yeah .

37294:26	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###And I mean , I still , unfortunately have *-1 to be very disciplined in *-2 doing my work at five in the morning and ten o'clock at night , E_S ###SpeakerA67 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB68 . ###\[ but , \+ uh , but \] \[ it , \+ it 's \] worked out \[ for , \+ for \] my family , ###* to have my cake and eat it too , kind of thing . E_S ###SpeakerA69 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB70 . ###SpeakerA71 . ###Yeah , E_S ###that 's a good deal . E_S ###Where do you think 0 this is going *T*-1 in the future , E_S 
37347:44	###it 's a very personal thing . E_S ###SpeakerA85 . ###But , it would be nice if there could be an in-between , a middle ground somewhere . E_S ###SpeakerB86 . ###Yeah . E_S ###I think 0 it 's hard though when you talk \[ about , \+ about \] families \[ and , \+ and \] * raising children *T*-1 E_S ###because \[ ch- , \+ I think 0 children \] have a hard time *-1 understanding a middle ground . E_S ###I think 0 \[ they , \+ uh , they \] need security E_S ###and yet they , N_S ###I do n't know , E_S ###I , N_S ###from * speaking from my children , \[ the- , \+ they \] are n't real flexible when it comes to things like that *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA87 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB88 . 
37675:72	###Uh , so it 's like I said ###* spending money does n't guarantee you , uh , winning a pennant . E_S ###SpeakerB88 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA89 . ###It really does n't , E_S ###so . N_S ###SpeakerB90 . ###Well and \[ that , \+ I think 0 that 's \] maybe part of it \[ that , \+ that \] the , um , N_S ###and it , you know , N_S ###if I owned the team .

E_S 
37847:95	###SpeakerA41 . ###I could n't believe that . E_S ###SpeakerB42 . ###Right . E_S ###You know , \[ one , \+ that 's one \] reason 0 we bought a house here in Plano *T*-1 .

E_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###but , uh , I can definitely , uh , see 0 on down the road , you know , where we do have kids and are getting to that age *T*-1 , that 's going *-2 to be a definite concern . E_S ###SpeakerA45 . ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ we talked , \+ you talked \] \[ about \+ before , about \] the school funding . E_S ###I think 0 there 's only going *-1 to be one solution to school funding which I do n't think 0 *T*-2 will be necessarily the best way E_S ###but I think 0 what *T*-1 's going *-2 to have *-3 to happen is 0 there 's going *-4 to have *-5 to be tuition for grade school and junior high and high school kids . E_S 
37955:28	###\[ You got * to , \+ you got *-1 to \] be your child 's best friend , I guess 0 *T*-3 , even when they 're a teenager and they , you know are kind of standoffish *T*-2 , E_S ###SpeakerB78 . ###Right .

E_S 
38655:42	###Yeah , E_S ###that 's the one 0 I was thinking of *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB64 . ###Yeah . E_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] bought that one , E_S ###and I did n't get \[ into , \+ involved in \] that one as well . E_S ###There 's another one 0 he wrote *T*-1 that *T*-2 even sounds better , E_S ###and it 's kind of the whole concept of global peace , you know , like , and \[ communities \+ * building communities . \] E_S ###SpeakerA65 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###Someone just recently said something really neat about that .

40934:11	###and some of those other places I would n't have *?* . E_S ###SpeakerA275 . ###That 's exactly it .

41619:7	###And I think 0 that does make a difference , E_S ###because when you do have *-1 to be in front of people *T*-2 , uh , I think 0 *T*-3 \[ you , \+ \] \[ the , \+ the \] tendency there is * to wear dresses and suits \[ and , \+ and , \] uh , more classical style of clothing . E_S ###SpeakerB27 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA28 . ###SpeakerB29 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA30 . ###What about the mini skirt ?

44706:4	###SpeakerA73 . ###Uh-huh .

44922:6	###That , N_S ###uh , perhaps we 'll finally get the youth weaned *-1 off of it .

46574:16	###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB132 . ###I think 0 it 's too easy for them . E_S ###SpeakerA133 . ###Uh-huh .

47741:37	###I think 0 that helps a lot . E_S ###I think 0 that 's the key , in \[ he , \+ like his \] sales last year N_S ###he just works a normal job .

E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###Something that I feel 0 *T*-1 \[ is a , \+ is \[ a , \+ \] \] pretty much an invasion of privacy is something that *T*-2 's really so common that it 's accepted *-3 as the norm now , is \[ the op- , \+ the open \] office concept .

51076:6	###Well , \[ they take , \+ they take \] my name , which *T*-1 is a very common name , E_S ###and my last name is even more common E_S ###SpeakerA61 . ###Uh-huh .

57573:4	###and you could n't sell the thi- , N_S ###I mean , though for what you could get *T*-1 for one , you might as well drive it over a cliff . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###Oh , yeah . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###And , uh , the injector pump went bad E_S ###so I found a outfit down here 0 *T*-1 to rebuild it .

58364:14	###SpeakerA49 . ###but they decided *-1 to do it to make themselves in sync with the rest of Europe , or the rest of continental Europe E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###\[ and , \+ you know . But \] that must have been tremendously difficult 0 * to orchestrate *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB52 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###SpeakerB54 . ###I 'm sure . E_S ###SpeakerA55 . ###Um , so \[ \[ \[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I , \] \+ I , \] \+ I \] think 0 it *EXP*-1 's essential that it 's done E_S ###and I think 0 the real trick is * to avoid the you know , N_S ###a little more attention to human psychology E_S 
58916:9	###SpeakerA160 . ###It 's nice over there . E_S ###SpeakerB161 . ###Yeah , E_S ###it 's sort of funny , E_S ###I have people that *T*-1 want *-2 to go to Dallas . E_S ###SpeakerA162 . ###Oh , really . E_S ###SpeakerB163 . ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ one of my , \+ one of my \] friends here , he was just talking how he 's thinking of *-1 leaving the company and going to Dallas *T*-2 , E_S ###* saying how , N_S ###SpeakerA164 . ###Oh , yeah , E_S ###no kidding . E_S 
59005:39	###SpeakerB20 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###SpeakerB22 . ###Oh , that is good . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###I mean I did n't work , E_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] needed *-1 to E_S ###but I did n't . E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ Steve 's , \+ Steve has \] a sister who *T*-1 has four . E_S ###She just had her fourth one in , uh , March E_S ###and she does n't have *-1 to work either . E_S ###I do n't know how they do it *T*-1 . E_S 
59058:6	###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###Because I work now , E_S ###I work full time E_S ###and , uh , you know , it , N_S ###when you put them through college *T*-1 it just takes just about everything 0 you got *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###They get loans and grants and scholarships and stuff like that , E_S ###that helps out , E_S ###but still , it cost a lot . E_S ###SpeakerB42 . ###Oh , yeah , E_S ###I mean , just \[ the , \+ you know , the \] cost of living 
59341:20	###I do n't know if the T I in Dallas does or not . E_S ###\[ I know , \+ I know \] 0 nobody around here does , it , E_S ###\[ we 're , \+ it 's \] too small around here . E_S ###SpeakerA131 . ###Oh really . E_S ###SpeakerB132 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###Well , um , I 'm , uh , pretty pro gun control over all . E_S ###\[ I , \+ uh , I 've \] had a lot of arguments with people about the issue of gun control E_S ###and , uh , I must say that there are a couple of arguments against , uh , strong gun control which I find *T*-1 very compelling , although most the people who *T*-2 argue gun control with me I find , uh , 0 *T*-3 use sort of canned arguments , you know , sort of the N R A slogan arguments E_S ###and , um , uh , see I 've been very frustrated when I do debate with people about it *T*-1 . ###Um , E_S I guess 0 on \[ a one , \+ a scale \] of one of ten I 'm probably around a two in terms of fair * restricting guns E_S ###and I have *-1 to admit 0 most of that is , uh , strong personal distaste . E_S ###I do n't like the idea of people being able *-1 to kill me with very little effort . 
59537:65	###as it stands now if he pulls a blade on me we 're equally matched *-1 because I can meet him blade for blade . E_S ###SpeakerA67 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB68 . ###Now if this legislation comes through , E_S ###he pull- , N_S ###I 'm out with my family E_S ###SpeakerA69 . ###Uh-huh .

59934:9	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###Um , but \[ we , \+ um , we \] house sat for \[ a , \+ um , \[ my , \+ um , my \] \] wife 's boss a couple weeks ago E_S ###and , um , uh , he has a dog and everything , E_S ###\[ we were , \+ you know , we were \] sitting the dog and everything E_S ###and , uh , I felt like just miserable all weekend E_S ###and it really did n't dawn on me until Sunday , E_S ###it was like , hey , maybe you 're still allergic to the dog . E_S ###It was like , oh , that could be it . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###The thing *ICH*-2 0 I do n't like *T*-1 about dogs sometimes is that the house will just reek , of the dogs , and constantly . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###SpeakerA21 . 
60241:4	###and she was very affectionate . E_S ###She would , you know , crawl on me E_S ###and she would sit like on my neck or my shoulder while I was working , and things like that . Yeah , much more than you would think . E_S ###SpeakerA115 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB116 . ###SpeakerA117 . ###Oh , yeah , E_S ###I mean , you know , if you get them *-1 young and everything before they go , kind of nuts , N_S ###so . N_S ###SpeakerB118 . ###Yeah E_S ###and , N_S ###SpeakerA119 . ###Yeah , E_S 
60276:14	###again it gets into vivant much fun , , you know what , I guess 0 they can be *?* . E_S ###I , N_S ###SpeakerB126 . ###Actually it was more fun than you would think .

E_S ###SpeakerB128 . ###And so it *EXP*-1 's almost impossible * to , N_S ###it *EXP*-1 's not fair to a pet *ICH*-2 * to have a pet here , or \[ certainly , \+ certainly \] not a dog , E_S ###SpeakerA129 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB130 . 
61420:41	###SpeakerB102 . ###they can *?* . E_S ###SpeakerA103 . ###so that would make you really , tend *-1 to worry about them , you know , if they 're not right there E_S ###SpeakerB104 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA105 . ###SpeakerB106 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Well , but he 's a real feisty guy . E_S ###He fights with other cats in the neighborhood because he does n't want them on our property . E_S ###SpeakerA107 . ###Is that right ? E_S ###SpeakerB108 . ###He 's , N_S 
61455:8	###so , you know , I never really had them around me , you know , E_S ###so I 've never owned one , you know , since I , N_S ###SpeakerB114 . ###Well , they 're really a lot different than dogs because \[ they 're not , \+ they 're very \] independent , E_S ###and \[ they 're very , \+ he 's very \] affectionate when he wants *-1 to be *?* *T*-2 , E_S ###but if you want him to be *?* and he does n't want *-1 to be *?* , \[ he 'll just , \+ he 'll , \] you know either scratch you or run away . E_S ###SpeakerA115 . ###Huh . E_S ###SpeakerB116 . ###But when he wants *-1 to be *?* *T*-2 , uh , he 's really affectionate .

E_S ###SpeakerA117 . ###Huh . E_S ###SpeakerB118 . 
61550:23	###SpeakerB150 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerA151 . ###So I ca n't , N_S ###\[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I \] just have not , N_S ###I do n't understand , you know , because it 's , like , he 's got a good home , you know , E_S ###he 's got , N_S ###I mean , we have two kids , you know , that *T*-1 just love him a lot , E_S ###SpeakerB152 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah .

62612:56	###\[ \[ \[ I think \[ just , \+ uh , just , \] uh , one of the \[ maj- , \+ major , \] \+ I think 0 it was a , \] \+ you know , I do n't , \] \+ I think \] 0 it was , uh , you know , like a Highlands or something like this .

E_S ###SpeakerA115 . ###Do n't they ? E_S ###Well , this \[ \[ is , \+ is \] \+ was \] a regular , uh , electronics store , you know . E_S ###SpeakerB116 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA117 . ###So , \[ I do n't think , \+ I do n't think \] 0 there will be too much problem E_S 
63275:6	###and you give it some sort of a weird metric number like six point two eight seven instead of six millimeter . E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah , E_S ###direct conversion . E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###\[ I , \+ I \] do n't know . ###Uh . E_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###I think 0 they \[ \[ just ought *-1 to , \+ you know , start , \] \+ uh , just go \] all the way on new products introduced * or whatever , you know , start your packaging , go to liters instead of quarts , E_S ###and you know , people if they have *-1 to *?* are going *-2 to learn *-3 to think that way . E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###Well \[ do n't most of them , \+ does n't just \] about everything now have both metric and English . E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###They do , E_S 
63283:81	###SpeakerB12 . ###I think 0 they \[ \[ just ought *-1 to , \+ you know , start , \] \+ uh , just go \] all the way on new products introduced * or whatever , you know , start your packaging , go to liters instead of quarts , E_S ###and you know , people if they have *-1 to *?* are going *-2 to learn *-3 to think that way .

E_S ###You buy a quart of milk , E_S ###and sure it \[ has , \+ has \] the metric equivalent written * on there , E_S ###but it still a quart . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###Oh , yeah , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . 
63465:43	###SpeakerA77 . ###you know , the differences between seventy and seventy-two or seventy-five degrees is n't much , E_S ###but the difference thirty and thirty-five degrees is , quite a bit . E_S ###SpeakerB78 . ###* Is about twice as much , what it works out to *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA79 . ###Yeah , E_S ###five . E_S ###SpeakerB80 . ###One point eight times as many points . E_S ###SpeakerA81 . ###Yeah , E_S ###something like that . E_S ###SpeakerB82 . ###Yeah , E_S 
63578:61	###SpeakerB110 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I think 0 they , N_S ###you got the problem with all your cars are still , N_S ###yeah , E_S ###you still got cars on the road that *T*-2 do n't have both . E_S ###SpeakerA111 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB112 . ###At that time , anyway , that was still when things were , N_S ###the metric system was still not , N_S ###SpeakerA113 . ###Not all that common . E_S ###SpeakerB114 . ###You know , now cars , they have both . E_S 
63753:6	###that 's , uh , one of the things 0 I wonder about *T*-1 , E_S ###uh , one of the questions was , do you think 0 more *ICH*-2 should be done *-1 , or something else . E_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] wonder about some of the \[ prod- , \+ products \] that they do n't take *T*-1 , like some of the plastics and things that they do n't take *T*-2 . Uh , \[ why , \+ why \] they could n't do more recycling with those *T*-3 . E_S ###SpeakerB56 . ###Well , I was in , uh , Bizmart the other day , E_S ###and , what I do n't understand *T*-1 is 0 there is recycled paper in there , E_S ###and it cost more than regular paper . E_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###Um . E_S ###SpeakerB58 . ###And it was only , I think , uh , forty cents more , you know , fifty cents more , E_S ###but , It *EXP*-1 upset me * to realize \[ that , hey , the recycling \+ that they 're going through the expense of recycling , \] E_S ###SpeakerA59 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB60 . 
63857:45	###I was trying *-1 to remember what it was *T*-2 . ###Oh , I ca n't think of it now . E_S ###But \[ I was , \+ I was \] trying *-1 to get my , uh , kids , you know , to see different things that we could come up with *T*-2 for recycling purposes . E_S ###SpeakerA93 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB94 . ###And just anything , 0 * to , you know , recycle *T*-1 rather than keep *-2 throwing *T*-1 it away , E_S ###but my biggest problem is , 0 I take the bags out of the store , buy the bags * to bring the back , E_S ###and then I forget *-1 to bring them in the store . E_S ###SpeakerA95 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB96 . ###I 'm forever going back out to my car *-1 to pick up my bags *-2 to bring them and take my garbage back out . E_S ###I wish 0 they 'd really push this recycling bit , because \[ I never realized , \+ I really did n't realize \] how much stuff I actually throw *T*-1 away . E_S ###SpeakerA97 . 
65588:53	###but you do n't read many sports books E_S ###or , N_S ###SpeakerB180 . ###Well , not really . E_S ###Now my son does , E_S ###\[ I have , \+ I have \] a son that *T*-1 just turned sixteen , E_S ###SpeakerA181 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB182 . ###and he reads everything 0 \[ he gets , \+ he \[ gets his , \+ get his \] \] hands on *T*-1 .

65795:49	###Yeah . E_S ###It sounded 0 you were calling from around the world somewhere . E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###Anyway , so , uh , N_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###Well , N_S ###SpeakerA45 . ###but , uh , you know , I think , 0 uh , \[ they , \+ maybe they \] need *-2 to , uh , help *-3 promote that more .

E_S ###SpeakerB46 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###I do n't know , you know , what kind of options they 've got *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###Well , that 's something about what Germany 's supposed *-1 to be doing *T*-2 . Something similar to that right now . E_S 
66760:9	###SpeakerB62 . ###Okay , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA63 . ###On Candy , E_S ###C a n d y . E_S ###SpeakerB64 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA65 . ###Oh , in fact , I lived there oh , until \[ nineteen , \+ late nineteen \] fifties . E_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###Okay , E_S ###okay .

67102:12	###SpeakerA42 . ###Yeah E_S ###it really is *?* . E_S ###SpeakerB43 . ###Are you think of *-1 doing any , like , centuries , or ... N_S ###SpeakerA44 . ###Yeah , E_S ###that would be cool sometime if I could , you know , work up to that . E_S ###SpeakerB45 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###Yeah , E_S ###I just wondered if you were going *-1 to do that *ICH*-2 mostly or more like , you know , uh , uh , touring like from Vermont or , you know , that kind of , thing . E_S ###SpeakerA46 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerB47 . 
67262:12	###in fact a lot of people will ride outside in the snow . E_S ###They 've got a , uh , mountain bike , you know , with the big knobby tires . E_S ###SpeakerA104 . ###SpeakerB105 . ###SpeakerA106 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB107 . ###And , I do n't do that . E_S ###\[ I basically , \+ \[ I , \+ I \] pretty much \] lay off for the winter .

E_S ###SpeakerB109 . ###Uh , but I just , you know , more or less stocked , like an exercise bike and that kind of thing . , uh , E_S ###but , yeah , E_S 
68474:30	###SpeakerA61 . ###Uh , I wish 0 it were a little bit harder * to not serve on juries actually . E_S ###I mean , I know , 0 \[ \[ it , \+ it , \] \+ it 's \] tricky E_S because I know , you know , an awful lot of intelligent people who *T*-1 just , well N_S I 'm too busy *-1 to serve on a jury , E_S ###SpeakerB62 . ###Uh-huh .

69995:9	###so it 's a nice change . E_S ###So we 'll be here a couple of years E_S ###and we thought well , we 'll take advantage of it and see what all the Pacific coast is like *T*-1 .

E_S ###SpeakerA125 . ###Well , my wife 's originally from Virginia E_S ###and we lived there for about nine months E_S ###and that was a real change for me . E_S ###SpeakerB126 . ###Oh , I imagine .

71950:4	###\[ I , \+ I , \] um , clean houses part-time , E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###Uh-huh .

E_S ###Well , the husbands ' roles are almost nonexistent in family anymore in terms of * being the father figure E_S ###and with women working so much they 're kind of pulled *-1 out of it too . E_S ###SpeakerB54 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA55 . 
72079:4	###Yeah , E_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] think that , um , in the future , um , \[ the , \+ the \] family unit \[ as it , \+ as it \] once was known *-1 , \[ is , \+ is \] going *-2 to be nonexistent .

E_S ###Um , that 's hard 0 * to say *T*-1 . E_S 
72570:14	###Oh , jeez . E_S ###SpeakerA145 . ###But , uh , N_S ###SpeakerB146 . ###I know 0 the whole situation is bad up here , E_S ###we 're having a terrible time with the recession .

72633:26	###I , I read to them a lot . E_S ###SpeakerA169 . ###That 's good . E_S ###SpeakerB170 . ###And , uh , I think 0 they 've all developed kind of an interest in reading also .

E_S ###SpeakerB187 . ###SpeakerA188 . ###You know , it is just , 
84791:18	###SpeakerB18 . ###And we could , uh , read the things in the history books and understand what they said *T*-1 , when it was like , \[ we need food , \+ we need *-2 to raise food \] quickly because this place gets very cold very soon *T*-3 .

E_S ###And people , \[ \[ \[ I , \+ I , \] \+ I , \] \+ I \] guess 0 they \[ confus- , \+ confused \] discipline with punishment . E_S ###SpeakerA61 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB62 . ###You know . N_S ###SpeakerA63 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB64 . ###And , just , N_S 
87117:33	###SpeakerB36 . ###SpeakerA37 . ###Oh , yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###SpeakerA39 . ###Well , yeah , E_S ###that 's true . E_S ###And we have a gourmet friend that *T*-1 ca n't stand fish E_S ###so I mean he can get within , N_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###Oh , yeah , E_S ###well , one of my friends does n't eat any cheese at all . E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###Oh , my . E_S ###SpeakerB42 . 
87592:15	###SpeakerB76 . ###Right , E_S ###uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA77 . ###and then he said something , because his English was so poor \[ on , \+ for \] the most part , E_S ###\[ he , \+ he \] was so proud of himself for * giving \[ ex- , \+ all the correct \] answers \[ that , \+ that \] on the last one he said , oh , I never remember that answer E_S ###and that clued the investigator that he had memorized a series of answers . E_S ###SpeakerB78 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA79 . ###So , uh , N_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###Well , we , uh , N_S ###taxes , N_S 
88827:9	###but otherwise not *?* . Although I \[ ca- , \+ uh , would \] get quite a break on , on tuition . E_S ###SpeakerB109 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA110 . ###SpeakerB111 . ###Um , because you went there . E_S ###SpeakerA112 . ###Yeah , E_S ###because they , uh , allow for , uh , uh , tuition , uh , break for out of state students who *T*-1 children of alumnae . E_S ###SpeakerB113 . ###Um . E_S ###SpeakerA114 . ###SpeakerB115 . ###I did n't know that . E_S ###SpeakerA116 . 
89445:18	###No , E_S ###it could not be *?* , E_S ###because this house has around thirty four hundred square feet , E_S ###and it would never sell for three hundred forty thousand dollars . E_S ###SpeakerA62 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB63 . ###Just never . E_S ###SpeakerA64 . ###Well . E_S ###SpeakerB65 . ###Now , maybe , you know , that 's pretty close to what it would have sold for *T*-1 , uh , * brand new , E_S ###or that 's pretty much what it was built *-1 for *T*-2 . E_S ###It 's got an awful lot of nice things in it E_S ###but , you know , \[ I do n't think , \+ I think \] 0 it 's going *-1 to be a long time , if ever , when nice things and really quality construction and all the other additional amenities are really , uh , desirable *T*-2 . E_S 
89689:73	###Well , it 's , you know , E_S ###I think 0 we just , you know , listen to , \[ is \+ \] the fact that there are good solutions both inside and outside of nursing homes . E_S ###It 's just a matter of * finding , a good home . E_S ###SpeakerA26 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB27 . ###SpeakerA28 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB29 . ###\[ And , \+ and then , \] of course , there is always the problem of * being \[ able , \+ able \] *-1 to afford either of those solutions . E_S ###SpeakerA30 . ###Right . E_S ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB31 . ###And that , I think 0 *T*-2 is what *T*-1 is scary , E_S 
90602:18	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB43 . ###And , uh , a lot of those people have , N_S ###and at time , you know , they all knew one another . E_S ###SpeakerA44 . ###Right , E_S ###right . E_S ###SpeakerB45 . ###And now it has gotten , uh , that , uh , a lot of those people \[ \[ are d- , \+ have , \] \+ uh , have died \] off , E_S ###or , you know , what we are left *-2 with *T*-1 is \[ the , \+ the \] relatives \[ \[ of , \+ of , \] \+ of \] that group . E_S ###SpeakerA46 . ###The next generation , E_S ###uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB47 . ###And so , uh , it 's not quite as close as it used *-1 to be *?* . E_S 
90853:20	###SpeakerB30 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###so if the kid does change , they do n't have *-1 to transfer , E_S ###or they do n't have *-1 to , uh , uh , N_S ###I do n't know , ###they do n't have *-1 to give up years \[ of , \+ you know , of \] credit transfer and things . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###Yeah . E_S ###That 's disruptive . E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###SpeakerA35 . ###I normally , N_S 
90996:8	###I 'm not at \[ the col- , \+ the big College Park campus , \] you know , E_S ###that 's the big one with the football team . E_S ###SpeakerB82 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA83 . ###So \[ \[ I , \+ I think , \] \+ um , I think \] 0 you 're right , that \[ there 's a lot of , \+ there 's difficult decisions \] *ICH*-1 there based * on name recognition . E_S ###Um , you know , when I first was applying for graduate schools *T*-1 , I applied to some big programs *ICH*-2 , you know , in this area , like Stevens Institute of Technology , which *T*-3 is recognized *-4 in the Northeast \[ as , \+ as , \] you know , one step below M I T in a sense , you know , E_S ###SpeakerB84 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA85 . ###so it 's got big name recognition in this area , ###a big science school , no football team , but a big science school , E_S ###SpeakerB86 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA87 . 
91756:4	###\[ your , \+ you \] do n't have *-1 to come home , E_S ###so the Catholics would make a pilgrimage in older Europe , E_S ###but when the Protestant ethic happened in America *T*-1 , there were people who *T*-2 ever went out and , you know , went away from the family *-3 to seek their fortune , and then had *-3 to come back home for their reunion , so that , became their version of the pilgrimage . E_S ###SpeakerB75 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA76 . ###SpeakerB77 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA78 . ###But she had , N_S ###it was interesting , you know , E_S ###I do n't know how valid it is *T*-1 , E_S ###but she talked about that and how \[ the , \+ the \] big picnic table was the symbolic communion of the people gathering together *T*-1 , and , um , you know , about the bread and the ritual placement .

E_S ###Is there kind of a , you know , N_S ###salads go first and things like that ? E_S ###SpeakerB79 . ###Well , it 's , uh , N_S ###we have , uh , uh , kind of a core group \[ that , \+ that \] *T*-1 serves as , quote , officers of the organization , E_S ###SpeakerA80 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB81 . ###and they plan the reunions , E_S ###the organize \[ the , \+ \] you know , who *T*-1 is going *-2 to see to it that the coffee pot gets there , who *T*-3 's going *-4 to rent the tables , who *T*-5 's going *-6 to see to it that the silverware gets turned *-7 back to the caterer . E_S 
92420:17	###SpeakerB64 . ###SpeakerA65 . ###and the son-in-law and mother-in-law are sniping at each other and all , E_S ###and then when it comes time for him to throw her over *T*-2 , well , \[ the , \+ the \] teenaged son the night before tried *-1 to save her by *-3 hiding her . E_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerA67 . ###And she said no , E_S ###you ca n't do , you know , E_S ###he \[ ran her out , \+ was running \] \[ * to hi- , \+ \] in a wheelchair *-1 to hide her , E_S ###and she said , `` You ca n't do that . '' E_S ###SpeakerB68 . ###Huh . E_S ###SpeakerA69 . ###`` This is tradition . E_S 
92533:6	###SpeakerA103 . ###And \[ I do n't ever , \+ no matter what *T*-1 's on , I do n't ever \] just sit and watch T V .

E_S ###SpeakerB106 . ###No , E_S ###I do n't sit . E_S ###SpeakerA107 . 
92619:61	###SpeakerB6 . ###Well , \[ I just , \+ I \] thought 0 it was sad that \[ they , \+ it \] started out as a good program .

E_S ###SpeakerB10 . ###\[ and I , \+ and that \] concerned me , that people were using it as a way 0 * to get rid *-3 of things 0 they just did n't want *-4 to set *T*-1 at the curb or take to the dump *T*-2 , E_S ###SpeakerA11 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###SpeakerA13 . ###That 's right . E_S ###SpeakerB14 . 
93199:9	###We 're from Illinois originally . E_S ###SpeakerA60 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB61 . ###And we 've been down in Texas eighteen years , E_S ###and so , like you , we always try *-1 to make it , you know , back home *-2 to see the relatives . E_S ###We both still have family there . E_S ###SpeakerA62 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB63 . ###And that 's fun . E_S ###It brings back a lot of memories . E_S ###SpeakerA64 . ###Oh , yes . E_S ###SpeakerB65 . 
93377:39	###It is beautiful . E_S ###They have mountains . E_S ###We were an hour away from the mountains or an hour away from the shore . E_S ###SpeakerA126 . ###That 's really nice . E_S ###SpeakerB127 . ###And \[ it , \+ it \] is gorgeous . E_S ###They live in a small town called * David , which *T*-1 is northern Panama up near Costa Rica . E_S ###SpeakerA128 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB129 . ###And , uh , \[ \[ it 's , \+ it 's just , \] \+ it 's just \] a gorgeous country . E_S ###Most people do n't realize it . E_S ###I think 0 if they could get tourists coming to their country , they 'd improve the economy considerably . E_S ###SpeakerA130 . 
94119:23	###But , uh , this one has been well organized E_S ###and in fact it used *-1 to be at Lake Brownwood , E_S ###and now it 's Lake Texoma , because that 's more central location 0 for people from Oklahoma and Texas to come to *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###SpeakerB22 . ###I 'm sure 0 location 's really important as far as * figuring out where one ought *-2 to be *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###Very important , because , uh , you 'll start *-1 losing people if it 's too far * to go . E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###We have factions , when it 's one part *T*-1 , E_S ###\[ we , \+ I \] have one reunion on my mother 's side , E_S ###and we found that if it 's in a certain part of Texas , some people come , E_S 
94210:8	###and our grandchildren are going now . E_S ###SpeakerB56 . ###Oh that 's great . E_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###So it 's , uh , wound up that , uh , we 're the old folks now . E_S ###SpeakerB58 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA59 . ###But , um , they have various organized , N_S ###they have generally a volleyball net set * up and horseshoes , uh , 0 * to pitch *T*-1 , E_S ###and they organize a baseball game for the kids E_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA61 . 
94458:40	###and I think 0 \[ \[ that 's , \+ that 's , \] \+ that 's \] another root problem . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah , E_S ###you know , I wonder if that 's a root problem or not , E_S ###because I think about that a lot , E_S ###and it 's just like , everybody likes *-1 to blame everything on drugs now , E_S ###but I wonder , you know , E_S ###do you get the , N_S ###oh , that 's kind of side tracked , E_S ###but , uh , I just remember *-1 seeing on the news the other night , 0 they had the thing about how Catholic schools are doing so much better *T*-2 E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###I thought , well , you know , of course they 're doing better , 
94489:63	###SpeakerB24 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###SpeakerB26 . ###Yeah , E_S ###this is interesting because in my mind I do n't have the stereotype of a Catholic school being a suburban kind of environment , E_S ###but , uh , \[ this , \+ this \] was actually inner city E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###people were sending , N_S ###I mean , just because their kids had the ability \[ and the , \+ and the \] drive *-1 to \[ do , \+ try \] and get an education , they did n't send him to a public school , you know , E_S ###like you said , you have the drug problem and just the general atmosphere where you 're pressured *-1 not to learn *T*-2 in instance , E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###Yeah , E_S 
94920:49	###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerB166 . ###however , my older son came home E_S ###and he said , Mom , I do n't like that man , E_S said , he took me by the head and dunked my head under the water and told me 0 I had *-1 to get my face wet or I 'd never swim E_S ###SpeakerA167 . ###Oh , gosh , E_S ###SpeakerB168 . ###SpeakerA169 . ###Oh , dear . E_S ###SpeakerB170 . ###boy , E_S ###it *EXP*-1 did n't take me very long * to hot foot it over to the school and relay that to them , E_S ###SpeakerA171 . ###Yes . E_S ###SpeakerB172 . 
95602:39	###and , I mean , of course , he is from the depression , E_S ###and , uh , so , uh , you know , it 's his life , E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###SpeakerA31 . ###Sure . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###but , uh , \[ I would , \+ I think 0 it would \] be smart if somebody would keep , uh , some sort of a plan that *T*-1 works for them . E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###Yeah . E_S ###I think 0 you are right , um , uh , E_S ###well \[ i- , \+ it \] must have been sort of interesting to us E_S ###\[ is * to , \+ uh , it 's \] because , ###since I have pretty much kept my record books for the last fifteen years , I guess 0 *T*-1 , I can go back and look E_S 
95636:47	###Yes . E_S ###SpeakerB42 . ###but , * \[ to look , \+ to have looked \] back into the twenties , thirties and forties , it *EXP*-1 would have been fantastic , * to see that . E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###Oh yes . E_S ###SpeakerB44 . ###But , uh , N_S ###SpeakerA45 . ###Well , as a matter of fact , uh , my mother was going through some things *ICH*-2 \[ not lon- , \+ not long \] ago , I guess 0 it has been a couple of years ago , in an old trunk that she had *T*-1 . E_S ###And she came upon \[ a , \+ a \] budget book that she had *T*-1 back in the thirties . Uh , when they , N_S ###SpeakerB46 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###it was the late , well N_S ###I guess 0 \[ it would have been , \+ I will take that back , it must have been \] in the forties , because they had been married , uh , probably fifteen years at the time . E_S 
95975:18	###SpeakerB12 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###And I , N_S ###boy that 's \[ a nice , \+ a nice \] place 0 * to visit *T*-1 . E_S ###It 's really nice at , N_S ###there 's a \[ nice , \+ nice \] train ride that *T*-1 goes up to the city of Silverton where they used *-2 to do a lot of silver mining *T*-3 . E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###\[ And , \+ uh , and then \] actually , \[ north , \+ north \] of that is *T*-1 another town \[ and , \+ \] \[ a smaller , \+ on a smaller \] scale , I guess , than Silverton . E_S ###\[ But , \+ I , and then \] there 's lots and lots \[ of real , \+ of mountains \] that *T*-1 are covered *-2 with , uh , boulders . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . 
96462:59	###SpeakerA127 . ###Because , I know that \[ there , \+ now there , \] they want the armed forces to recognize that women can serve in combat roles . E_S ###SpeakerB128 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA129 . ###And the only , uh , branch in the armed \[ fo- , \+ services \] that *T*-1 seems willing *-2 to do that is the Air Force . E_S ###And , uh , I spoke because women were \[ filing , \+ flying \] missions \[ \[ into , \+ you know , for whatever reason , into , \] \+ uh , in \] the Persian Gulf war . E_S ###SpeakerB130 . ###Huh . E_S ###SpeakerA131 . ###SpeakerB132 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA133 . 
96852:20	###But do n't you think 0 it 's that way with men too ? E_S ###I mean , you know , men are sitting behind desks a whole lot more , than they used *-1 to . E_S ###SpeakerB88 . ###Oh , absolutely true E_S ###\[ it 's , \+ that 's \] true with society , in general , E_S ###SpeakerA89 . ###SpeakerB90 . ###SpeakerA91 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB92 . ###but specifically the woman 's role , in society has changed . E_S ###SpeakerA93 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB94 . 
96852:33	###But do n't you think 0 it 's that way with men too ? E_S ###I mean , you know , men are sitting behind desks a whole lot more , than they used *-1 to . E_S ###SpeakerB88 . ###Oh , absolutely true E_S ###\[ it 's , \+ that 's \] true with society , in general , E_S ###SpeakerA89 . ###SpeakerB90 . ###SpeakerA91 . ###Yeah , E_S ###yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB92 . ###but specifically the woman 's role , in society has changed . E_S ###SpeakerA93 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB94 . 
97038:9	###That 's a part of the problem that women have always had *T*-1 E_S ###and that is * accepting responsibility for things that *T*-1 really are other people 's responsibilities . E_S ###SpeakerA171 . ###That 's very true . E_S ###SpeakerB172 . ###\[ They , \+ They , \] N_S ###SpeakerA173 . ###And then that way , we have not changed in , hundreds of years , have we *?* . E_S ###SpeakerB174 . ###SpeakerA175 . ###SpeakerB176 . ###That 's right . E_S ###SpeakerA177 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB178 . 
97332:43	###And so I think , you know , 0 she will be at a , N_S ###I have heard 0 it 's a rough age 0 * to put them into a , N_S ###SpeakerB86 . ###It is *?* because that 's when they are clinging to mama *T*-1 , E_S ###SpeakerA87 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB88 . ###so you might have a real problem with that . E_S ###I think 0 \[ it , \+ it *EXP*-1 \] hurts the parents * to leave when the child is crying *T*-2 , E_S ###SpeakerA89 . ###\[ But , \+ but \] I think 0 it , N_S ###SpeakerB90 . ###so \[ it , \+ you know , it \] would be ideal if you could get somebody in so you are not really leaving the child in a strange place . E_S ###SpeakerA91 . ###Yeah . E_S 
97445:36	###SpeakerA129 . ###SpeakerB130 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA131 . ###SpeakerB132 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA133 . ###SpeakerB134 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA135 . ###we might be able *-1 to exchange that way . E_S ###SpeakerB136 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA137 . 
97451:23	###SpeakerA133 . ###SpeakerB134 . ###Uh-huh , E_S ###uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA135 . ###we might be able *-1 to exchange that way . E_S ###SpeakerB136 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA137 . ###And so we will just have *-1 to see how things work out *T*-2 . E_S ###But \[ I think 0 the whole , \+ you know , ideally I think , \] uh , 0 business should have the , day care centers there , whether it 's the parents who *T*-1 take turns *-2 watching the kids , or whether E_S ###SpeakerB138 . ###I do too . E_S ###SpeakerA139 . ###they hire a couple of people E_S 
97640:23	###well I am done *-1 talking . E_S ###Do you want *-1 to talk ? . E_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###Well , I think that you carried forth your subject matter very well , uh , Nickie . E_S ###And I can , uh , relate to that , uh , E_S ###SpeakerB54 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA55 . ###uh , I think 0 \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] the image that the woman has *T*-1 and , uh , in the world , as , uh , the lesser of the two . E_S ###SpeakerB56 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###SpeakerB58 . ###Oh , always . E_S ###SpeakerA59 . 
97657:43	###SpeakerB60 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA61 . ###And , uh , I think 0 we are progressing at a snail 's pace , E_S ###SpeakerB62 . ###Indeed . E_S ###SpeakerA63 . ###but we are progressing . E_S ###SpeakerB64 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA65 . ###So , that 's the main point is that we are going ahead . E_S ###SpeakerB66 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA67 . 
97834:74	###SpeakerA143 . ###And \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] just marvelous , E_S ###and I am just in awe * to see this , E_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###Well , what movies have you seen *T*-1 recently , Valerie ? E_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###* Let 's see , E_S ###the last one 0 we saw *T*-1 was THELMA AND LOUISE . E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Oh , we have n't seen that one yet . E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###Well , * do n't bother . E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###Oh , it was n't that good . E_S ###SpeakerB6 . 
98217:20	###SpeakerA12 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB13 . ###You know , and I think 0 most of that is because their parents are n't around . E_S ###That make sense ? E_S ###SpeakerA14 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB15 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA16 . ###\[ \[ That , \+ uh , the , \] \+ what they call *T*-1 the \] latchkey children . E_S ###SpeakerB17 . ###Yeah , E_S ###something like that . E_S ###No one 's , you know , N_S 
98427:14	###but nowadays , there 's so much on TV \[ where , \+ where \] people seem *-1 to have the idea 0 they can get something for nothing *T*-2 . E_S ###Of course uh , I work for lawyers a lot E_S ###SpeakerB95 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA96 . ###and I see , 0 unfortunately , we have this whole mentality that somehow there are these pots of money out there that you can sue somebody and , you know , there 's a million dollars 0 you can have *T*-1 uh , for mental duress or whatever *T*-2 *T*-3 . E_S ###SpeakerB97 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA98 . ###SpeakerB99 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA100 . ###But , you know , the other thing that *T*-1 bothers me in the crime is the , uh , N_S ###in Europe , they seem *-1 to have mentality , E_S ###and drunk driving is a good one , E_S 
98639:28	###SpeakerB41 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA42 . ###if it 's first degree rape , second \[ deg- , \+ degree \] rape or whatever , they only get *-1 to decide on that , E_S ###well , okay this person has been charged *-1 with first degree rape , uh , E_S ###and you can decide guilt or innocence on that . E_S ###SpeakerB43 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA44 . ###Uh , such like , maybe in murder they get *-1 to choose whether it 's , uh , premeditated or one or two of the lesser degrees . E_S ###The other thing that juries are restricted *-1 on *T*-2 \[ and , \+ and \] at least to me this has been one of the frustrating things \[ in my , \+ even in my \] own experiences , that you usually do n't get *-3 to hear all the information . E_S ###SpeakerB45 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA46 . ###It 's what information *T*-1 is presented *-2 E_S 
100012:29	###SpeakerB18 . ###And she got kind of fearful of *-1 being on her own . E_S ###She never really ate very well . E_S ###It was one thing . E_S ###She hardly ever took care of herself E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###and she did n't eat . E_S ###She ate very poor E_S ###so I think 0 she was , you know , ###bad , uh , nutrition on top of it . E_S ###And , uh , she got to the point 0 she did n't want *-1 to alone anymore . E_S ###So , N_S ###SpeakerA21 . 
100047:4	###SpeakerB30 . ###Oh really ? E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###Well she did n't want *-1 to cook for herself anymore . E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###Oh , that 's too much trouble . E_S ###That 's too much trouble . E_S ###* Did n't want *-1 to cook . E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###And the portions , E_S 
100663:67	###Huh . E_S ###SpeakerB52 . ###SpeakerA53 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB54 . ###And that 's overwhelming . E_S ###SpeakerA55 . ###Well \[ we 've got , \+ uh , you know at our school we have \] over a thousand elementary kids E_S ###and last year was the first year that we ever had more than one counselor *T*-1 . E_S ###And that 's just really not enough . E_S ###SpeakerB56 . ###No . E_S ###It is n't *?* . E_S ###SpeakerA57 . ###And I was talking to somebody that *T*-1 teaches in a middle school E_S 
100948:38	###SpeakerA42 . ###She went back as a teenager E_S ###and these people that *T*-1 had changed her diapers when she was three *T*-2 were still there . E_S ###SpeakerB43 . ###Oh , my gosh . E_S ###SpeakerA44 . ###So , \[ it , \+ it \] was really neat . E_S ###But it was because they had a director that *T*-1 had always done it as a labor of love E_S ###and she just kept good people and real cheerful place , lots of arts and crafts , E_S ###SpeakerB45 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA46 . ###SpeakerB47 . ###Oh my goodness . E_S ###SpeakerA48 . 
101805:14	###SpeakerA32 . ###SpeakerB33 . ###Like a lot , E_S ###it seems like the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer , is even more , true today . You know ? E_S ###SpeakerA34 . ###SpeakerB35 . ###SpeakerA36 . ###Yeah , E_S ###there is \[ a \+ a \] big difference in the , uh , economic , um , status of , uh , people although I think 0 that has been true , uh , always . E_S ###SpeakerB37 . ###S- , N_S ###SpeakerA38 . ###Um , perhaps there 's less of the middle range then there was *?* . E_S ###SpeakerB39 . ###Yeah . E_S 
101884:4	###I mean even if they had *-1 to pay more now , I mean in the long run it *EXP*-3 's going *-2 to cost society more * to force two people to work . Even though it 's higher productivity is short-term . E_S ###SpeakerA62 . ###That 's right . E_S ###SpeakerB63 . ###SpeakerA64 . ###\[ It 's already , \+ It already \] costs society much more because of it . E_S ###SpeakerB65 . ###SpeakerA66 . ###You know it , N_S ###* trying *-1 to do all these programs like Headstart and things like those . You would n't have *-2 to do that if mothers would stay home with their children and do things with them , you know . E_S ###SpeakerB67 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA68 . ###Um , there 's , N_S ###and I think , uh , 0 a lot of it is selfishness . E_S 
102082:17	###SpeakerB40 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###And , uh , their pastas were great . E_S ###SpeakerB42 . ###\[ Tha- , \+ that 's \] one of the things , a good pasta means a lot to me . E_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] like different kinds of food . E_S ###So , when we go out *T*-1 , I 'm always looking for something other than the standard menu , even if , it 's a Mexican Restaurant , like something other than , uh , you know the standard tacos , enchiladas , tamales and fajitas now . E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###SpeakerB44 . ###SpeakerA45 . ###You 're brave . E_S ###SpeakerB46 . ###Yes , E_S ###yes E_S 
103101:22	###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###What *T*-1 's interesting , several years ago , I took a course , uh , on , uh , ###well , N_S \[ it was actually , \+ it was \] put *-2 on by the power companies \[ and , \+ \] about the various sources of energy and how much pollution there was *T*-1 , E_S and there was n't *T*-1 from various kinds \[ of , \+ of \] energy . N_S ###And , uh , at that point in time , one person that *T*-1 was a speaker brought up the topic of acid rain E_S ###and it was kind of pooh-poohed *-1 , you know . E_S ###Oh , you 're making a mountain out of a molehill , kind of thing . E_S ###And it 's turned out that , that 's been very true , what he was forecasting *T*-1 about the accumulation \[ of , \+ of \] the pollutants in the air and the acid rain and what it would do *T*-2 to foliage . E_S ###So , it 's kind of interesting the change in perspective from when I took that course *T*-1 . E_S ###Now , a lot of people are really afraid of nuclear . E_S ###Uh , I 'm not afraid of nuclear , *-1 having had that course because of how the nuclear that , uh , they use *T*-2 is not bomb quality *T*-3 , E_S ###and , we 're so strict with all our controls *ICH*-1 in the United States . 0 The chances \[ of , \+ of \] an accident are slight , E_S ###and , it does n't pollute the air at all . E_S ###It *EXP*-1 's safer *ICH*-2 * to be around a nuclear plant then it *EXP*-3 is *?* * to be around a coal plant . E_S ###Many more deaths *ICH*-2 have occurred in *RNR*-1 and * dealing with *RNR*-1 coal plants then ever around nuclear plants . E_S 
103451:14	###SpeakerA78 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB79 . ###But , uh , I do n't know . ###It 's just , N_S ###SpeakerA80 . ###Well , \[ I was , \+ I saw \] on a human interest story , or whatever today , 0 there was a woman who *T*-1 was just being paroled *-2 and trying *-2 to make it back , E_S ###she was off drugs and everything , E_S ###SpeakerB81 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA82 . ###but she said , uh , you know , 0 in prison you can get anything . E_S ###You can any drugs 0 you want *T*-1 . E_S ###There 's , N_S ###\[ it , \+ it 's \] just like * being outside . E_S 
103983:18	###SpeakerA33 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###but on the plastic , \[ I have , \+ uh , I do n't have \] any habits there yet E_S ###and \[ I 'm , \+ * guess 0 I 'm \] waiting for the city \[ to , \+ to \] push me in that direction E_S ###\[ but , \+ But , \] it just seems like on the larger scale that , you know , \[ the , \+ \] we always talk about *T*-1 in our society is that economic strife things E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###Well , I guess 0 they will *?* shortly . E_S ###I , uh , N_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###and I think \[ if , \+ uh , if \] we just start *-1 to put , you know , the nickel deposit on things , like , uh , * was the case years ago that , uh , it would have more immediate *ICH*-2 effect , uh , \[ than , \+ \] N_S ###because I remember *-1 searching ditches for beer bottles because they were worth money E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###Oh , right . E_S ###SpeakerB38 . 
104480:30	###We live next to a set of railroad tracks E_S ###and it *EXP*-3 seemed *-1 to be a very popular thing for people driving by that highway there , by our tracks to throw the bottles at the tracks and try *-2 to \[ crash , \+ you know break \] them , E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###but , uh , they were n't that successful , E_S ###so there were a lot of bottles 0 *T*-1 to be returned *-2 E_S ###and we just walk about a half a mile in each direction and gathered up enough * to buy whatever we wanted *T*-1 for the day E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###and , N_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###Yeah , E_S ###and they , uh , p- , N_S 
104742:9	###so * let 's give money to AIDS . E_S ###And yet we 've had breast cancer problems for years . E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###And , it 's just N_S ###\[ one of those , \+ uh , course , one of the \] shows 0 I saw *T*-1 was taking it from the angle that , since it does n't effect men , it 's not going *-2 to get funded *-3 . E_S ###And , uh , * having thought about that for a while , N_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###What did you think *T*-1 about that idea ? E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###Well , \[ \[ I , \+ I kind of , \] \+ I \] thought , well , \[ that , \+ that \] might be possible since there are a lot of men in control of that kind of thing . E_S ###But then \[ I got , \+ I got \] to *-2 thinking , 0 \[ the , \+ the \] number one killer of men seems *-1 to be the prostate E_S ###and there 's only one test that *T*-1 just recently got developed *-2 , uh , a \[ \[ blood in- , \+ antigen , \] \+ uh , antibody test for the antigen in the blood \] E_S ###and that 's fairly recent . E_S 
104860:36	###SpeakerB6 . ###just about N_S like \[ \[ train \+ tr- , \] \+ train \] wrecks and things like \[ that , \+ that \] N_S ###I feel like , N_S ###probably just for our own safety when we 're traveling and things *T*-2 that would be something 0 I 'd like *-1 to know that *T*-3 's going on . E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ I , \+ well , I \] happen *-1 to be , ###uh , N_S my job is 0 I 'm supervisor of personnel safety for the world 's largest paint company , E_S ###so I , N_S it 's very near and dear to me when we start *-1 talking about drug testing for random sampling and testing for cause , this type of thing *T*-2 . E_S ###And even in our field we have people that *-1 are in very high risk jobs E_S ###and we , at the present time , do not have random testing . E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###Um . E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###And I am pushing towards that . E_S 
104957:11	###\[ \[ I , \+ I \] would like , \+ I would encourage \] it . E_S ###I 'm pushing our company towards that . ###MUMBLEx . E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###Well , and , you know , if they do find someone \[ who , \+ who \] *T*-1 is , uh , having a problem with drugs E_S and they can get them the help that they need *T*-1 . As opposed to *-2 just letting the problem go on \[ with , \+ without \] any , uh , support . And whatever , N_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###SpeakerA39 . ###Exactly . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###because a lot of people , * seems like *T*-2 , \[ would probably \+ obviously are \] trying *-1 to hide that uh , from their employer and friends and family and things E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB42 . 
105019:8	###It was n't like the newer ones that *T*-1 have nice chambers that *T*-2 keep it afloat or keep it , uh , upright again . E_S ###This one you had *-1 to work with *T*-2 . E_S ###You get out of the water again and get it upright . E_S ###And , uh , sailing \[ was , \+ was \] kind of nice ###*-1 to learn the maneuvers you had * to make *-1 to work your way down a lake or work back up against \[ the , \+ the \] wind , as it were , *-2 tacking back and forth E_S ###and , uh , more than once we 'd get out there on a really stormy day E_S ###and , uh , the storm or the wind was due to the front blowing E_S ###and as soon as the front came over , it was calm . ###So you 're out in the middle of nowhere with a paddle E_S ###and you paddle your way back in and hope 0 it does n't start *-1 raining on you right away . E_S ###And that did n't always work . E_S ###We oftentimes got wet , . E_S ###But , uh , \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] a \[ nice , \+ nice \] hobby 0 * to have *T*-1 .

106188:27	###SpeakerA45 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB46 . ###but he was living alone , had an upstairs apartment , could barely make it up the steps to the top without a great deal of pain , E_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###Oh .

E_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###Yes , E_S 
106188:57	###SpeakerA45 . ###Yeah .

107176:6	###Bye-bye . E_S ###SpeakerB96 . ###Bye . E_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###How would you go about *-1 organizing a family reunion *T*-2 ? E_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###Well , a- , N_S ###for , N_S ###I grew up in the deep south like south Alabama .

E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###And there would be like thirty people . E_S 
107250:4	###SpeakerB2 . ###Well , I do n't do much of it here . E_S ###I 'm \[ from , uh , Te- , \+ from , uh , Colorado \] originally E_S ###and there are no bugs there .

107462:68	###I do n't know E_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] like that idea . E_S ###Um , oh , I had a thought just a second ago E_S ###but it slipped my mind . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###Oh , that 's all right . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###Um , \[ \[ one thing that I- , \+ that I think \] \+ probably one of the reasons that \] people do n't vote more *T*-1 is because they do n't know the candidates .

E_S ###I know 0 there 's been a couple of people that we voted for *T*-1 and worked for E_S ###and when they got in office *T*-1 it was just a disaster . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###Well , N_S ###SpeakerB18 . 
107960:14	###Well , around there you can probably wear , uh , T-shirts and other things , E_S ###but around here , at this time of the year we are into sweaters and , uh , coats . E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###SpeakerA19 . ###I 'm envious . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###SpeakerA21 . ###Well , it 's a beautiful day here , E_S ###and it 's in the sixties , E_S ###but we still have a lot of hot afternoons , E_S ###it 's supposed *-1 to be eighty-five today , E_S ###so you 'll still see people , E_S ###\[ it , \+ it 's \] kind of an in between change , that \[ they 're in their play clothes , \+ I mean , they 're in their summer clothes \] during the afternoons , because you just ca n't stand the sweaters , E_S

109078:34	###Yeah , E_S ###\[ it , \+ it 's \] sad , E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###and , \[ it , \+ you know , it \] was almost from the audience participation it was almost a social issue , you know E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###Uh-huh .

139264:6	###well , it 's based *-1 here , E_S ###uh , the international headquarters for Wycliff Bible Translators is right here \[ in , \+ in \] Dallas .

E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###Well , the cooperative learning is a technique that *T*-1 was tried *-2 initially * to integrate the public schools .

E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###Uh-huh .

E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###Uh , I think that the combination of , uh , technology and techniques like that together with marketplace forces will bring about a revolution in the way 0 we learn *T*-1 . E_S ###Uh , I think 0 there is a direct threat to vested interest in the public school system , uh , that *T*-1 will stand in the way of that progress being a little faster . E_S 
144108:14	###you were assumed *-2 guilty until proven * innocent ###and once they found you guilty , you know , judge said , he 's guilty , ###* kill him . E_S ###Well , \[ th- , \+ there \] were some people \[ that , \+ uh , that \] *T*-1 had a problem with that .

E_S ###SpeakerB51 . ###And he 'll say , you know , hey , that guy *ICH*-1 did it , you know , not me . E_S ###SpeakerA52 . ###Yeah .

144204:68	###they looked real good E_S ###and , N_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###\[ They , \+ they \] do , E_S ###and they , you know , N_S ###I think 0 \[ by , \+ uh , by \] * relieving some of the pressure off \[ of , \+ uh , of , \] uh , uh , N_S ###Michael Jordan really helped them out . E_S ###You know , \[ he does n't have , \+ they do n't have \] *-1 to rely on him *-2 to score \[ ev- , \+ \] you know , thirty or forty points \[ at every \+ at every \] game E_S ###SpeakerA17 . ###Right .

144843:21	###SpeakerA59 . ###SpeakerB60 . ###Uh , I never thought about someone robbing those , E_S ###but , apparently , they do .

E_S ###SpeakerA63 . ###It 's \[ kind of , \+ kind of \] stupid , is n't it . E_S ###SpeakerB64 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA65 . 
144978:99	###You bet . E_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###You know , \[ \[ I , \+ I \] go to a , \+ I have a club that \] I belong to *T*-1 on Tuesday that , N_S ###you know , one of the girls travels quite extensively E_S ###and she says , well , my children have two parents .

E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###So \[ \[ that , \+ that 's \] a , \+ I think 0 that 's a \] change E_S ###and I think 0 that 's a change 0 you 're going *-1 to be seeing more of *T*-2 \[ in the , \+ in the \] future , people having that kind of attitude that the father 's going *-3 to take more active role in child rearing . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###Sure . E_S ###I think , uh , 0 it 's the age old thing , E_S 
145112:4	###I do n't know , E_S ###I 'm kind of \[ out of , \+ out of \] things . E_S ###SpeakerA61 . ###You see the old , uh , cigarette ads , you know , about you 've come a long way .

146835:29	###but I am going *-1 to stick with Downey because they were first . E_S ###SpeakerB67 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA68 . ###And I want them to have my business . E_S ###And I think 0 packaging could be done *-1 much better . E_S ###There is so much plastic . E_S ###But , N_S ###SpeakerB69 . ###Well I know , E_S ###you see some of the stuff E_S ###and then when they come out with the new things *T*-1 , you are like , well why did n't you think of that before *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerA70 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Yeah . E_S 
147121:14	###That 's what , I would think *T*-1 . E_S ###SpeakerB7 . ###But \[ I , \+ I \] do n't know for sure .

E_S ###SpeakerA10 . ###Right . E_S ###Yeah , E_S ###I think 0 the automobile *ICH*-2 definitely is an area and \[ any , \+ any \] industry that *T*-1 burns , you know , E_S ###and then I do n't know about chemical pollution .

147225:131	###\[ and , \+ uh , so \] yeah , E_S ###we can comment E_S ###and we did n't see this a few years ago . E_S ###SpeakerB45 . ###No , E_S ###and I think , N_S ###SpeakerA46 . ###It was pretty clear here . E_S ###SpeakerB47 . ###Yeah , E_S ###and I think \[ that , \+ that \] more and more it *EXP*-3 's becoming apparent to people that the earth , which *T*-1 includes all the people on it and everything that *T*-2 's going on it , \[ is a , \+ is an \] organism of sorts , and that there is \[ a , \+ a \] whole set of organic relationships that if we start *-4 to destroy one part of it , *T*-6 it 's going *-5 to tell us about it , E_S ###SpeakerA48 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB49 . ###and , uh , we 're going *-1 to feel it , E_S 
147347:6	###I want *-1 to see the nursing home . If I have *-2 to put him into one . E_S ###You know , where I can go *-2 see it *T*-1 . E_S ###\[ I , \+ I 'd \] be very uncomfortable with him being in Colorado . E_S ###And , N_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###Oh , why yeah . E_S ###I am sure 0 you have got some really good nursing homes around Dallas . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###Yes . E_S ###And some of them are limited care *ICH*-2 too where people can do , uh , N_S ###like they have apartment styles , E_S ###but that would n't work for him . E_S ###I think 0 he is beyond that . E_S ###Where if you need help you can get it *T*-1 , E_S ###but basically people kind of have a small apartment E_S 
148447:14	###SpeakerB44 . ###Oh , yeah ? E_S ###SpeakerA45 . ###So , uh , that 's where \[ my two , \+ my two \] listening enjoyments are *T*-1 , E_S ###but , you know , jazz can get on my nerves after a while .

148970:21	###SpeakerA29 . ###Um , \[ do you think , \+ I mean , do you think , \] 0 \[ our invest- , \+ the investment \] in lives and money was worth it ? E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###No , E_S ###\[ not , \+ not \] really . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###I totally agree with that . ###Um . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###Um .

E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###They have nice plans E_S ###\[ and , \+ uh , but , \] they do n't always work E_S ###and then you know they try *-1 to raise taxes more E_S ###and I do n't what *T*-1 happens with all the money because if their plans do n't work , N_S you know , 
152992:142	###SpeakerA5 . ###That 's the one 0 I watch *T*-1 . E_S ###I usually keep up with T V .

E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###so I get a lot of stuff through the grapevine which *T*-1 \[ is \+ really is n't \] too great sometimes . E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA9 . ###SpeakerB10 . ###Yeah , E_S 
153450:19	###because I mean I do think that some people need them \[ and , \+ \] like , for protection and stuff E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###and I can understand them wanting *-1 to have them , E_S ###but then again it 's just like all those nuts out there . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###Well , you know , uh , uh , no- , E_S ###if you are looking at like you know country \[ that , \+ uh , where \] they do have a lot more gun control *T*-1 , like England and places like that , you know E_S the amount of violent crime has decreased by so much . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###It has *?* ? E_S ###Because then , N_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###Well I mean yeah . E_S ###\[ The , \+ uh , the \] N_S 
153578:52	###SpeakerB76 . ###SpeakerA77 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB78 . ###and I just did n't want the responsibility . E_S ###SpeakerA79 . ###Um . E_S ###SpeakerB80 . ###So . Well , uh , did you hear about that Killeen massacre or whatever ? E_S ###SpeakerA81 . ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ the , \+ did it \] happen at a cafeteria or something ? E_S ###SpeakerB82 . ###Yeah , E_S ###right . E_S 
153672:9	###SpeakerA23 . ###Yeah . E_S ###That 's , N_S ###I guess 0 I kind of do a similar thing . More , uh , medium or longer range . E_S ###I just have a maybe a targeted amount that I will save for *T*-1 . E_S ###Like I am , N_S ###probably within a year I would like *-1 to buy a new car . E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###So , I kind of have \[ a , \+ an \] amount in my mind E_S ###and I am making every effort *-2 \[ to , \+ to \] \[ sal- , \+ put \] a little bit away and increase the amount that I need *T*-1 for a down payment or whatever . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###Yeah . E_S 
154950:27	###and since I am not a tennis player , uh , you know , I do n't get that , E_S ###but \[ \[ I am , \+ you know , I am between , \] \+ I am in \] my late forties E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###so , uh , there are n't many people , you know , that *T*-2 want *-1 to do that . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###Most of the people that *T*-1 are in the classes are young mothers .

155000:14	###I do n't have a problem . E_S ###I know 0 I have *-1 to do more aerobics , E_S ###but I do n't have a problem with weight . E_S ###I could eat all day and not gain an ounce . E_S ###SpeakerB48 . ###Well see , \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] \[ th- , \+ \] really good E_S ###and I think 0 that keeps \[ a lot , \+ some \] people from *-1 exercising . E_S ###SpeakerA49 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###I mean , I do n't have a problem with weight either , E_S ###but I think 0 I do n't have a problem because I exercise .

157583:94	###yeah , E_S ###\[ \[ the , \+ the , \] \+ the \] income tax is a lot more visible portion of the taxes 0 you pay *T*-1 , I guess 0 *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerB42 . ###But you probably pay more *ICH*-1 percentage wise in other taxes . E_S ###SpeakerA43 . ###Uh-huh .

157583:106	###yeah , E_S ###\[ \[ the , \+ the , \] \+ the \] income tax is a lot more visible portion of the taxes 0 you pay *T*-1 , I guess 0 *T*-2 .

E_S ###SpeakerA47 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB48 . 
157662:116	###But , N_S ###SpeakerB13 . ###I would like *-1 to do that . E_S ###I 've been out here twenty some years E_S ###and I 've been called *-1 , uh , three different times , E_S ###but I 've never actually even made it into \[ the , \+ the \] jury box . \[ And , \+ \] because there have always been a number of people E_S ###SpeakerA14 . ###Oh . E_S ###SpeakerB15 . ###\[ and , \+ and \] I 've never gotten up there *-1 to answer any of the questions . E_S ###Uh , I , N_S ###yeah , E_S ###I also think 0 that would be really good . E_S ###I , N_S ###SpeakerA16 . 
157673:106	###yeah , E_S ###I also think 0 that would be really good . E_S ###I , N_S ###SpeakerA16 . ###Well , the people 0 I know *T*-1 who *T*-2 have served have said that usually what *T*-3 ends up *-4 happening is that , you know , after initially * finding out where people stand *T*-5 , that the whole deliberation usually results , if there is \[ a , \+ you know , something like a \] nine , three \[ or , \+ or \] more severe \[ and , \+ and \] the people in the majority trying *-6 to convince the minority that they 're right E_S ###SpeakerB17 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA18 . ###and in fact , I 'm not sure that that 's any more , uh , liable *-1 to get rid *-2 of the reasonable doubt \[ than , \+ than \] anything else . E_S ###SpeakerB19 . ###Well , \[ the , \+ the \] one thing that I know 0 *T*-1 does seem *-2 to happen from people 0 I 've talked to *T*-3 on this , is that in the situation 0 you just said *T*-4 where it 's nine to three , or some such number *T*-5 , \[ that there 's , an effect 0 *T*-7 starts *-8 being \+ that there 's starts *-6 being \] a lot of peer pressure going on E_S ###SpeakerA20 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB21 . ###and \[ that \+ that , \] uh , peer pressure , N_S 
158267:12	###SpeakerA17 . ###So . N_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###Uh , \[ th- , \+ the \] other argument is that the death penalty is a deterrent E_S ###and I really do n't , uh , agree with that . E_S ###I do n't think 0 anyone who *T*-1 would commit \[ a , \+ uh , a \] crime that *T*-2 would get them the death penalty would stop at the moment and say , well , I was about *-3 to kill and dismember this person E_S ###but , oh , if they catch me they 're going *-1 to kill me E_S ###so I better not do it . E_S ###\[ I , \+ I \] just , do n't think \[ that , \+ uh , that \] it works that way . E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###SpeakerA21 . ###I do n't think 0 it 's done *-1 . E_S ###I do n't think 0 we run it as a deterrent . E_S 
159568:6	###SpeakerB45 . ###SpeakerA46 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB47 . ###an elderly person can , you know , N_S ###it 's like a newborn baby . E_S ###You need *-1 to have twenty-four hour care uh , answering all the needs cause they ca n't do much for themselves at certain points . E_S ###SpeakerA48 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB49 . ###SpeakerA50 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB51 . ###SpeakerA52 . ###Right . E_S 
160030:4	###SpeakerB18 . ###SpeakerA19 . ###Huh , well , I guess 0 what we have *T*-1 is \[ like a f- , \+ what they call *T*-2 a flex \] benefits plan where \[ you , \+ you \] get like a certain amount of dollars E_S and then you spend it on a cafeteria of whatever you want or need *T*-1 *T*-3 . E_S ###Otherwise \[ you can , \+ uh , * guess 0 you can \] \[ \[ put , \+ also put money , \] \+ hold money \] back and then either use or lose it and that does n't get taxed *-2 or can just have that money , you know , put *-1 in your paycheck . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###Yeah , E_S ###we have one of those * use it or lose it plans *ICH*-1 , too , where , uh , they 'll basically pay for , uh , you know , child care type , uh , expenses *T*-2 . E_S ###I \[ can send in a , \+ uh , can send in a \] request for payment E_S ###\[ and they 'll , \+ uh , and they 'll \] send me , you know a check for the amount 0 they withheld *T*-1 . E_S ###That 's pretty good , you know . E_S ###\[ It 's , \+ uh , it \] saves a third off on taxes or something . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###Yeah , E_S ###well , it depends on which company you work for *T*-1 . E_S ###I know that , like , \[ \[ the , \+ the , \] \+ the \] one plan that everyone seems *-1 to be in *T*-2 , in my place is , uh , you know , \[ you , \+ uh , * think 0 you \] call it *RNR*-3 plan D . E_S 
160079:53	###my place you get two weeks when you start *T*-1 E_S ###and then \[ every , \+ every \] year they give you an extra day until you 've got four weeks . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###Oh , that 's nice . E_S ###We do n't get them \[ till , \+ till \] your seventh year of service till you get an extra week . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###Aye . E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###SpeakerB34 . ###That 's a long time . E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###Yeah , E_S ###it 's , uh , N_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###Yeah , E_S 
160996:46	###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA71 . ###But , you know , the other thing is , 0 it 's tricky , though , E_S ###because like in New Hampshire , they say , oh , all right , * let 's cut the military budget . E_S ###SpeakerB72 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA73 . ###Well , yeah , E_S ###then , you lose half your jobs in New Hampshire E_S ###SpeakerB74 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA75 . ###you lose , N_S ###Grotten Connecticut goes , E_S ###so , you know , \[ it 's like , \+ you know , it *EXP*-1 's very \] tricky * to balance that stuff off , because then you hurt , you know , N_S 
161302:17	###Oh , okay . E_S ###SpeakerA107 . ###SpeakerB108 . ###Oh , okay . E_S ###SpeakerA109 . ###SpeakerB110 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA111 . ###I mean , these people had left this infant in the same room with this loose ferret . E_S ###\[ The , \+ the \] ferret is used to *-1 running the house and was kind of wild E_S ###SpeakerB112 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA113 . ###and , you know , they should expect something like that to happen . E_S ###And so bas- , N_S 
161493:18	###it 's , a lot of people \[ l- , \+ like , \] saying that , you know , bands in that position , you know , sold out . E_S ###SpeakerB20 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA21 . ###I think 0 that 's pretty much , you know , bull . E_S ###Because R E M really has n't changed . E_S ###If , ###\[ it 's , \+ it 's \] interesting . N_S ###SpeakerB22 . ###SpeakerA23 . ###They 're producing , uh , similar music E_S ###and it 's good music E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA25 . 
162080:24	###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA49 . ###But , well , \[ she had decided that it was , \+ when we came back to the States *T*-1 , she decided that it was \] too , N_S ###she did n't feel that public schools \[ were s- , \+ were safe , \] E_S ###so next thing 0 you know *T*-1 she 's teaching in a maximum security prison . E_S ###SpeakerB50 . ###Yeah , E_S ###right . E_S ###SpeakerA51 . ###But , uh , N_S ###SpeakerB52 . ###Well , at least it 's maximum security , right . E_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###Yeah . E_S ###\[ But , \+ but \] the point \[ that \+ \] was , that it , you know , N_S 
163180:4	###That may very well be . E_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###\[ I , \+ I \] hold it in the utmost contempt . E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###Uh , E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###\[ \[ The , \+ uh , d- , \] \+ my \] favorite is the police department , E_S ###they 're not aimed *-1 at the criminal . E_S ###The judicial system is aimed *-1 at the citizens E_S ###because you and I , we have work schedules , E_S ###we can be called *-1 at work , E_S ###we have Social Security numbers , E_S ###they can trace us down , E_S ###we have telephones , E_S ###then we have checkbooks . E_S 
163741:22	###at least at the end . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###I mean , I do n't know , E_S ###I , N_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###Yeah , E_S ###\[ \[ i- , \+ i- , \] \+ they \] were very good at first , E_S ###they were in very good financials at first E_S ###and , uh , that 's part of the reason 0 he became a nominee *T*-1 is because things went so well . E_S ###And then , of course , the bottom fell out . E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###\[ \[ It 's , \+ uh , I mean , it 's , \] \+ it 's \] tough . E_S ###I mean , \[ there 's , \+ there 's \] two ways 0 you can kind of go *T*-1 *-2 to get out of tough financial situations . E_S ###I guess 0 you can like raise taxes and then create like job programs and whatnot E_S 
163908:64	###\[ You hear a , \+ you hear a \] Paula Abdul song E_S ###and you , N_S ###and I think , 0 if somebody else were *-1 to play that , you know , \[ they would n't , \+ \[ \[ they , \+ nobody , \] \+ everybody \] would \] think , that 's lousy , E_S ###but because she did it , it 's supposed *-1 to be good , you know , E_S ###it comes to the point where it 's your name , not what you do *T*-1 *T*-2 more than anything . E_S ###SpeakerA53 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB54 . ###Madonna can do anything E_S ###and it would be considered *-1 good because it 's Madonna , you know . E_S ###SpeakerA55 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB56 . ###Madonna could start *-1 playing folk music E_S ###and folk music would be huge just because Madonna does it , E_S 
164098:95	###SpeakerB30 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###But , even so , \[ \[ it , \+ I mean , it 's , \] \+ it *EXP*-1 's \] still difficult for me to convince my apartment mates \[ to , \+ to \] like lock the doors when they go out *T*-2 , you know , and things like that . E_S ###SpeakerB32 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###SpeakerB34 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###Uh , it *EXP*-3 would be so easy for someone who *T*-1 is motivated *-4 to do so to just , you know , sit out back , take a look at when people are here *T*-2 and when they 're not *?* *T*-5 just come in , you know , E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA37 . ###there 's a T V and a V C R E_S 
164190:25	###SpeakerB26 . ###Sure . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###something that *T*-1 will carry it around careful , I guess 0 *T*-3 is \[ best , \+ best \] way 0 * to describe it *T*-2 . E_S ###Right now , we 've got a V six E_S ###and \[ it , \+ that \] seems *-1 to be just fine . E_S ###I know 0 \[ they s- , \+ they 're coming \] out with some V eight now E_S ###and I think 0 that 's probably a little over kill for this day and age . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###Yeah , E_S ###I was surprised *-1 to hear that the V eights are coming back , E_S ###so , they 've got some pretty powerful sixes . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . 
164292:110	###So I know 0 I 'd be happy with \[ a , \+ a \] reasonable , uh , four door . E_S ###You know , again , \[ we 've , \+ we 've \] got the same issue with *-1 getting kids into the , N_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###What kind of crime do you think , uh , 0 *T*-1 is the most prevalent in our society ? E_S ###SpeakerB2 . ###Oh , boy , probably , uh , robberies , people stealing from each other . E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Such as New York City ? E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###Is that what *T*-1 happens up there a lot ? E_S ###Uh , \[ \[ th- , \+ that , \] \+ that 's \] mostly what I hear *T*-1 , though , is people getting ripped *-2 off and things getting stolen *-3 . E_S ###That 's the most prevalent crime . Uh , \[ the ones that *T*-2 really , \+ you know , the ones that *T*-1 really \] add up after a while , I guess , you know , \[ from , s- , \+ far as \] insurance money and stuff like that , insurance costs . E_S ###You know , everybody has *-1 to pay for it indirectly eventually . E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###Yeah , E_S 
166032:9	###Well , here they \[ and , \+ \] N_S ###uh , * live in an apartment complex . E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###And they only have one set of recycling bins , one or two sets as opposed to a set at each of the dumpsters . E_S ###So a lot of the people who *T*-1 live up front do n't bother *-2 to recycle because , you know , it *EXP*-3 's too far * to carry the stuff to the other bins . E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###\[ \[ I , \+ I know 0 a lot , \] \+ I think 0 a lot \] of , uh , \[ the , \+ the \] issues with regard to recycling are that , uh , people have *-1 to be motivated *-2 \[ to do , \+ to do \] something like that because it does take extra effort . E_S ###Whether N_S ###\[ \[ and , \+ and I think that , \] \+ and I know \] 0 Massachusetts has , N_S ###a bottle bill was passed *-1 E_S ###and we have had a bottle bill for quite a few years now , E_S ###and the majority of the incentive in * recycling bottles probably , * believe it or not , is just * to get the extra nickel at \[ the , uh , \+ the \] store and not , uh , N_S ###that 's the majority of people that I know of *T*-1 anyways . E_S 
166040:13	###\[ \[ I , \+ I know 0 a lot , \] \+ I think 0 a lot \] of , uh , \[ the , \+ the \] issues with regard to recycling are that , uh , people have *-1 to be motivated *-2 \[ to do , \+ to do \] something like that because it does take extra effort .

E_S ###Where people are n't really , you know , eco conscious *T*-3 . It 's just the fact that it 's something 0 they have *-2 to do *T*-1 . E_S ###And I 'm not going *-1 to throw a bottle away , E_S ###it 's like * throwing a nickel away . E_S ###That type of thing . E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###Right . E_S ###\[ \[ They , \+ Th- , \] \+ here they 're \] trying *-1 to push through a bill E_S ###SpeakerA9 . 
166079:8	###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB16 . ###SpeakerA17 . ###\[ Th- , \+ there \] definitely has *-1 to be a motivation factor E_S ###and I know that , \[ at w- , \+ where I work *T*-1 , \] N_S ###I work for a defense contractor . E_S ###And there 's a big push on for * recycling , uh , paper materials , you know , computer output paper and also * to decrease the amount of , uh , Styrofoam usage because of \[ the , \+ uh , the \] process involved in Styrofoam \[ and , \+ and \] the whole eco issue and that .

E_S ###I think 0 \[ that 's , \+ that 's \] what they need *-1 to do *T*-2 . * Be more proactive like that . E_S ###SpeakerB18 . ###Uh , \[ I know , \+ uh , I believe \] 0 it was last year that they actually collected the old phone books *T*-1 .

166108:36	###SpeakerB22 . ###They contain the glue and stuff E_S ###and they used *-1 to have *-2 to take out all the , uh , pages and then cut the spine off *-3 to be able *-4 to recycle them . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###Now I think 0 they 've come up with some way of , uh , * pulling the glue out . E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###Yeah . E_S ###Okay . E_S ###SpeakerA1 . ###Uh , * let 's see . E_S ###How \[ about , \+ uh , * let 's see , about \] ten years ago , E_S ###uh , what do you think 0 *T*-2 was different *ICH*-1 ten years ago from now ?

170600:9	###I mean , there were five of us E_S ###and I do n't recall , you know , *-1 wanting anything in particular . E_S ###Uh , but I do n't know how my father did it *T*-1 .

E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###Well , that 's true .

171383:15	###\[ Th- , \+ the \] sentencing is really light compared to what I think 0 they should be *T*-1 in a lot of cases you know , ###uh , E_S ###SpeakerA19 . ###Yeah .

E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA25 . 
171391:33	###SpeakerB22 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA23 . ###But people who *T*-4 \[ d- , \+ do n't \] have day in and day out life long experience with what prison is really like *T*-1 and what the options are *T*-2 , * to ask them *-3 to decide for one case , on one person , based on what they see *T*-5 , I think 0 that is maybe , uh , a little bit naive . E_S ###SpeakerB24 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA25 . ###In Texas here , people tend *-1 to get whipped *-2 up into a frenzy and slap long sentences on people . E_S ###SpeakerB26 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA27 . ###Uh , it 's kind of , uh , uh , a hanging jury atmosphere . E_S ###SpeakerB28 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA29 . 
171414:6	###SpeakerB32 . ###Yeah . E_S ###\[ That 's , \+ that 's \] not a bad system . E_S ###But \[ I , \+ I \] do think 0 it needs *-1 to be shaken *-2 up a little bit . E_S ###SpeakerA33 . ###Yeah .

E_S ###SpeakerA35 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB36 . ###SpeakerA37 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###SpeakerA39 . 
171556:16	###So I felt kind of good about that , you know . E_S ###I did n't even know the person *ICH*-2 's name that *T*-1 had given me the hard time or anything E_S ###SpeakerB34 . ###Uh-huh .

E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###Right , E_S ###right . E_S ###SpeakerA39 . 
171602:4	###and , uh , \[ \[ they usually get , \+ you know , \[ they , \+ they \] make things are , \] \+ they ma- make * sure 0 things are \] set *-2 properly if you 're any way dissatisfied with their merchandise .

171874:48	###SpeakerA38 . ###but I 've been trying more this year . E_S ###I think 0 I know a little more than I use *-1 to *?* . E_S ###SpeakerB39 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA40 . ###I never knew very much at all E_S ###so I 'm trying . E_S ###SpeakerB41 . ###Well , it 's a good past time , you know . E_S ###SpeakerA42 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerB43 . ###Particularly football . E_S ###They say , uh , 0 \[ i- , \+ \] football attracts more men because of \[ \[ \[ the , \+ you know , \[ y- , \+ \] the , \] \+ you see the , \] \+ the \] physical aggression on the field E_S 
172319:4	###It 's a real easy 0 * to use *T*-1 color , uh , computer E_S ###and I got a very nice printer that *T*-1 goes along with it E_S ###and he uses it for his school work . E_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###Uh-huh . E_S ###Well , \[ I 've , \+ I 'm \] currently in school E_S ###so \[ I , \+ I 've \] had an I B M clone *ICH*-2 , I guess 0 *T*-3 , for a couple of years now , which I 've been trying , continually upgrading *T*-1 I guess .

E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###\[ it , \+ it 's \] \[ pr- , \+ very \] essential for me . E_S 
172611:271	###I , N_S ###SpeakerB59 . ###SpeakerA60 . ###and if I were , uh , N_S ###when I was single *T*-4 and again when I 'm retired *T*-5 , I will not mind *-1 paying , uh , what it takes *T*-2 * to keep the schools good .

E_S ###SpeakerA64 . ###I do , E_S ###yeah , E_S ###that 's true . E_S 
172785:47	###You do n't want *-1 to start over again anywhere . E_S ###SpeakerA59 . ###Yeah , E_S ###you 're right .

E_S ###SpeakerB60 . ###Well , I think 0 \[ \[ they 're at , \+ they 're com- , \] \+ they 've come \] a long way . ###Uh , ###at least some companies . ###Some of them , uh , ###my girlfriend , in particular , that *T*-1 works for \[ a , \+ a \] rental car agency E_S ###SpeakerA61 . ###Right .

172856:11	###Right .

E_S ###I know 0 \[ it 's , \+ it 's \] a lot , you know , \[ that , \+ uh , that \] I feel \[ like , \+ you know , just like \] you said , that , there 's just so much that you can do *T*-1 yourself .

172939:61	###\[ I 'm , \+ I , \] N_S ###but there , N_S \[ this is , \+ this is , \] \[ tax \+ not tax \] revolt country .

E_S ###SpeakerB38 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA39 . ###So , you know , it 's not exactly that kind of a place \[ that , \+ that \] you want *-1 to , you know , get into a tax revolt situation *T*-2 . E_S ###SpeakerB40 . ###Right . E_S ###SpeakerA41 . ###But , uh , uh , \[ the , \+ uh , the \] local taxes here *ICH*-1 , \[ I , \+ I , \] N_S \[ i- , \+ in \] this particular area , uh , you know , \[ I 've , \+ uh , I think \] 0 I pay about , uh , oh thirty-five hundred *ICH*-3 \[ for , \+ for \] taxes on my four bedroom house , you know .

173383:8	###And most of them from other places . E_S ###SpeakerB30 . ###Yeah . E_S ###SpeakerA31 . ###Uh , J C Penney 's come down from New York and , of course , T I and Xerox from Rochester E_S ###and we just , have lots of people from everywhere .

E_S ###Uh , not that I am *?* E_S 
173549:18	###And they could be using this time better . E_S ###SpeakerB102 . ###Well , for example , in my son 's kindergarten . They 're really finished at lunch time . E_S ###After lunch , they have some , uh , N_S ###I 'm trying *-1 to think if they have recess after lunch , E_S ###and then they have naps or rest period . E_S ###SpeakerA103 . ###Uh-huh .

E_S ###SpeakerB106 . ###I agree . E_S ###SpeakerA107 . 
173823:73	###Uh-huh . E_S ###SpeakerA5 . ###So , uh , N_S ###SpeakerB6 . ###What *ICH*-2 do you feel that your kids are getting *T*-1 in the parochial schools that they would n't get *T*-3 in \[ a , \+ the \] public school system ? E_S ###SpeakerA7 . ###Well , one hundred percent of the , uh , customers care . E_S ###That 's one thing . E_S ###Everybody cares about the education 0 the kids are getting *T*-1 . E_S ###And , uh , they , uh , take an \[ active , \+ relatively active \] part .

174201:25	###How you doing *T*-1 ? E_S ###SpeakerA3 . ###Pretty good . E_S ###SpeakerB4 . ###Good .

E_S ###SpeakerB8 . ###So , uh , \[ what are your , \+ what are your \] thoughts on the subject *T*-1 there ? E_S ###SpeakerA9 . 
174222:4	###It 's probably the safest thing . E_S ###SpeakerB12 . ###Yeah . E_S ###I mean , it *EXP*-1 's to easy * to get a quorum E_S ###SpeakerA13 . ###Yep . E_S ###SpeakerB14 . ###and simple majority wo n't do . E_S ###SpeakerA15 . ###No .

174356:4	###and he really gets into *-1 suing people .
