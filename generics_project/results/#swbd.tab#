1349:38	machines	answering machines	are	are nice 	machines	but that's, that's where answering machines are nice , because if it's really important they'll leave a message	###speakerb74.### but, so tho-, i guess  those three things are the, uh, uh, most irritating to me.###speakera75.###right.###speakerb76.###speakera77.###uh-huh.###i agree with the phone, too, in that,###i'm single,###but when i come home from work , there's times  i need  to pay bills ,###i need  to balance my checking account,###i need  to do all kinds of different things like that,###and even though it's friends calling, sometimes you just feel like, this is my quiet time,###i need  to get things done ###and the phone ringing bothers me,

14725:84	people	something that many people don't realize 	do	don't realize 	people	well, but you know, the, the strange thing, uh, perhaps, not strange, but something that many people don't realize , is that you can go back as far as nineteen fifty-one and fifty-two and find that there were drug dealers at that time trying  to influence the high school kids,	###yeah.###speakera47.###and, uh, somebody walks in there with a gun.###i mean, they're going  to want the money,###and you can tell by the people who  are always caught , that these people are there  to get money for drugs.###i mean, they don't want the money so, uh, so they can do something else with it.###speakerb48.###no,###they don't want the money for food,###that's for sure.###speakera49.###right,###right,###and so.###speakerb5.
15223:64	people	people	get	get older 	people	but i think  a lot of it's, you know, when the-, people get older , they'll do something like that.	###speakerb62.###yeah,###m-,###speakera63.###and the peace corps or something like that is probably useful as, as that kind of a time.###speakerb64.###yeah,###maybe a little bit in that perspective,### but, uh, and a lot of people have gone in the military, i mean, you know, when they're in the college .###sometimes it's  to sup-, help  support college, you know, the money.###speakera65.###uh-huh.###speakerb66.###uh, others, people don't know what they want  to do .###but as far as, uh, you know, the peace corps. i guess, i suppose  there's a few people that  have done it at that point in their lives.

37144:48	roles	women's roles	are	are changing faster than the men	roles	it, it seems too me like though that women's roles are changing faster than the men and therefore, the women are spreading themselves thinner, than before.	###i was afraid  we might get into an argument.###speakerb4.###right.###speakera5.###well, uh, i guess uh,  there have been certainly a lot of changes ich in the last couple of generations, for, uh, the roles of women###speakerb6.###uh-huh.###speakera7.###and uh, i guess  the most significant probably is that so many are working now, and trying  to juggle job and home and family and all sorts of other possibilities, you know,###speakerb8.###right.###speakera9.###they may be going to school, or may have elderly parents, or you know all sorts of other things.###speakerb1.###yeah,
3719:24	things	other things	suffer	suffer	things	uh, i think  sometimes other things suffer	###speakerb24.###right.###speakera25.###so, uh, yeah###and for a while i was going to school too,###and tha-, it was tough.###speakerb26.###yeah,### i uh, i think that while it exp's a good change for i think women to be able  to fulfill their potential in whatever they feel, you know,  their expertise may be .###speakera27.###uh-huh.###speakerb28.###speakera29.###uh-huh.###speakerb3.

37675:72	prices	ticket prices	are	are going  to be to the point where the average fan can't go  	prices	i, you know, i think that there's coming to a point ich real soon when ticket prices are going  to be to the point where the average fan can't go  	###uh, so it's like i said### spending money doesn't guarantee you, uh, winning a pennant.###speakerb88.###yeah.###speakera89.###it really doesn't,###so.###speakerb9.###well and that, i think  that's maybe part of it that, that the, um,###and it, you know,###if i owned the team. i think   you'd like them to do well###but the question of  losing big, big money that###what, did, did, did steinbrenner actually make money on the,###speakera91.###uh, you got me.
37847:95	people	people	are	are going  to throw a fit	people	that's the only way  they're going  to fund it , because if they start  raising taxes for property, and people are going  to throw a fit.	###speakera41.###i couldn't believe that.###speakerb42.###right.###you know, one, that's one reason  we bought a house here in plano .###we were hoping, you know, well  the school district's going  to be good, you know, for resale value, and, so on and so forth,###speakera43.###yeah.###speakerb44.###but, uh, i can definitely, uh, see  on down the road, you know, where we do have kids and are getting to that age , that's going  to be a definite concern.###speakera45.###yeah,### we talked, you talked about before, about the school funding.###i think  there's only going  to be one solution to school funding which i don't think   will be necessarily the best way###but i think  what 's going  to have  to happen is  there's going  to have  to be tuition for grade school and junior high and high school kids.
