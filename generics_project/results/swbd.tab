14725:84	people	something that many people don't realize 	do	don't realize 	people	well, but you know, the, the strange thing, uh, perhaps, not strange, but something that many people don't realize , is that you can go back as far as nineteen fifty-one and fifty-two and find that there were drug dealers at that time trying  to influence the high school kids,	###yeah.###speakera47.###and, uh, somebody walks in there with a gun.###i mean, they're going  to want the money,###and you can tell by the people who  are always caught , that these people are there  to get money for drugs.###i mean, they don't want the money so, uh, so they can do something else with it.###speakerb48.###no,###they don't want the money for food,###that's for sure.###speakera49.###right,###right,###and so.###speakerb5.

37847:95	people	people	are	are going  to throw a fit	people	that's the only way  they're going  to fund it , because if they start  raising taxes for property, and people are going  to throw a fit.	###speakera41.###i couldn't believe that.###speakerb42.###right.###you know, one, that's one reason  we bought a house here in plano .###we were hoping, you know, well  the school district's going  to be good, you know, for resale value, and, so on and so forth,###speakera43.###yeah.###speakerb44.###but, uh, i can definitely, uh, see  on down the road, you know, where we do have kids and are getting to that age , that's going  to be a definite concern.###speakera45.###yeah,### we talked, you talked about before, about the school funding.###i think  there's only going  to be one solution to school funding which i don't think   will be necessarily the best way###but i think  what 's going  to have  to happen is  there's going  to have  to be tuition for grade school and junior high and high school kids.

87117:33	dishes	so many dishes	require	require cheese	dishes	uh, so that's a real problem because so many dishes require cheese.	###speakerb36.###speakera37.###oh, yeah.###speakerb38.###speakera39.###well, yeah,###that's true.###and we have a gourmet friend that  can't stand fish###so i mean he can get within,###speakerb4.###oh, yeah,###well, one of my friends doesn't eat any cheese at all.###speakera41.###oh, my.###speakerb42.
87592:15	taxes	taxes	are	are too high	taxes	everyone thinks  taxes are too high i'm sure  .	###speakerb76.###right,###uh-huh.###speakera77.###and then he said something, because his english was so poor on, for the most part,### he, he was so proud of himself for  giving ex-, all the correct answers that, that on the last one he said, oh, i never remember that answer###and that clued the investigator that he had memorized a series of answers.###speakerb78.###uh-huh.###uh-huh.###speakera79.###so, uh,###speakera1.###well, we, uh,###taxes,
88827:9	schools	certain schools	do	do it	schools	well certain schools do it.	###but otherwise not . although i ca-, uh, would get quite a break on, on tuition.###speakerb19.###yeah.###speakera11.###speakerb111.###um, because you went there.###speakera112.###yeah,###because they, uh, allow for, uh, uh, tuition, uh, break for out of state students who  children of alumnae.###speakerb113.###um.###speakera114.###speakerb115.###i didn't know that.###speakera116.
89445:18	people	people	go	go for square footage only now	people	it's seems like people go for square footage only now	###no,###it could not be ,###because this house has around thirty four hundred square feet,###and it would never sell for three hundred forty thousand dollars.###speakera62.###yeah.###speakerb63.###just never.###speakera64.###well.###speakerb65.###now, maybe, you know, that's pretty close to what it would have sold for , uh,  brand new,###or that's pretty much what it was built  for .###it's got an awful lot of nice things in it###but, you know, i don't think, i think  it's going  to be a long time, if ever, when nice things and really quality construction and all the other additional amenities are really, uh, desirable .
89689:73	people	people	have	have  to put people in a nursing homes 	people	and i also feel that that's where some of the bad images of nursing homes come from . is when people have  to put people in a nursing homes 	###well, it's, you know,###i think  we just, you know, listen to, is the fact that there are good solutions both inside and outside of nursing homes.###it's just a matter of  finding, a good home.###speakera26.###right.###speakerb27.###speakera28.###right.###speakerb29.### and, and then, of course, there is always the problem of  being able, able  to afford either of those solutions.###speakera3.###right.###uh-huh.###speakerb31.###and that, i think   is what  is scary,
962:18	people	people	feel	feel less of a desire  to really go	people	so, i think  people feel less of a desire  to really go.	###uh-huh.###speakerb43.###and, uh, a lot of those people have,###and at time, you know, they all knew one another.###speakera44.###right,###right.###speakerb45.###and now it has gotten, uh, that, uh, a lot of those people are d-, have, uh, have died off,###or, you know, what we are left  with  is the, the relatives of, of, of that group.###speakera46.###the next generation,###uh-huh.###speakerb47.###and so, uh, it's not quite as close as it used  to be .
9853:2	parents	parents	hate	hate  to hear this, you know	parents	and, and parents hate  to hear this, you know,	###speakerb3.###yeah.###speakera31.###so if the kid does change, they don't have  to transfer,###or they don't have  to, uh, uh,###i don't know,###they don't have  to give up years of, you know, of credit transfer and things.###speakerb32.###yeah.###that's disruptive.###speakera33.###yeah.###speakerb34.###speakera35.###i normally,

94119:23	people	other people	come	come	people	and if it's elsewhere, other people come	###but, uh, this one has been well organized###and in fact it used  to be at lake brownwood,###and now it's lake texoma, because that's more central location  for people from oklahoma and texas to come to .###speakerb2.###uh-huh.###speakera21.###speakerb22.###i'm sure  location's really important as far as  figuring out where one ought  to be .###speakera23.###very important, because, uh, you'll start  losing people if it's too far  to go.###speakerb24.###uh-huh.###we have factions, when it's one part ,### we, i have one reunion on my mother's side,###and we found that if it's in a certain part of texas, some people come,

94458:4	schools	catholic schools	are	are generally considered  a little bit easier than the public schools	schools	and not so much when i was growing up , catholic schools are generally considered  a little bit easier than the public schools,	###and i think  that's, that's, that's another root problem.###speakerb16.###yeah,###yeah,###you know, i wonder if that's a root problem or not,###because i think about that a lot,###and it's just like, everybody likes  to blame everything on drugs now,###but i wonder, you know,###do you get the,###oh, that's kind of side tracked,###but, uh, i just remember  seeing on the news the other night,  they had the thing about how catholic schools are doing so much better ###speakera17.###uh-huh.###speakerb18.###i thought, well, you know, of course they're doing better,
94489:63	kids	kids	are	are going to a public parochial school like that	kids	well, you know, in a lot of cases like that, where, you know, if kids are going to a public parochial school like that, it's, it's because the parents are more interested in them receiving an education.	###speakerb24.###yeah.###speakera25.###speakerb26.###yeah,###this is interesting because in my mind i don't have the stereotype of a catholic school being a suburban kind of environment,###but, uh, this, this was actually inner city###speakera27.###yeah.###speakerb28.###people were sending,###i mean, just because their kids had the ability and the, and the drive  to do, try and get an education, they didn't send him to a public school, you know,###like you said, you have the drug problem and just the general atmosphere where you're pressured  not to learn  in instance,###speakera29.###yeah,
9492:49	kids	kids	do	do exaggerate	kids	and she said, well, she said, you know, kids do exaggerate,	###oh.###speakerb166.###however, my older son came home###and he said, mom, i don't like that man, said, he took me by the head and dunked my head under the water and told me  i had  to get my face wet or i'd never swim###speakera167.###oh, gosh,###speakerb168.###speakera169.###oh, dear.###speakerb17.###boy,###it exp didn't take me very long  to hot foot it over to the school and relay that to them,###speakera171.###yes.###speakerb172.
9562:39	things	things	have	have changed  over the years	things	and it exp's real fun  to just see how things have changed  over the years. uh,	###and, i mean, of course, he is from the depression,###and, uh, so, uh, you know, it's his life,###speakera29.###yeah.###speakerb3.###speakera31.###sure.###speakerb32.###but, uh, i would, i think  it would be smart if somebody would keep, uh, some sort of a plan that  works for them.###speakera33.###yeah.###i think  you are right, um, uh,###well i-, it must have been sort of interesting to us### is  to, uh, it's because,###since i have pretty much kept my record books for the last fifteen years, i guess  , i can go back and look
95636:47	things	things	cost	cost 	things	and, it exp was just, uh, fascinating  to see how little things cost ,	###yes.###speakerb42.###but,  to look, to have looked back into the twenties, thirties and forties, it exp would have been fantastic,  to see that.###speakera43.###oh yes.###speakerb44.###but, uh,###speakera45.###well, as a matter of fact, uh, my mother was going through some things ich not lon-, not long ago, i guess  it has been a couple of years ago, in an old trunk that she had .###and she came upon a, a budget book that she had  back in the thirties. uh, when they,###speakerb46.###uh-huh.###speakera47.###it was the late, well###i guess  it would have been, i will take that back, it must have been in the forties, because they had been married, uh, probably fifteen years at the time.
95975:18	people	people	jeep	jeep through that area	people	so, i guess  people jeep through that area	###speakerb12.###uh-huh.###speakera13.###and i,###boy that's a nice, a nice place   to visit .###it's really nice at,###there's a nice, nice train ride that  goes up to the city of silverton where they used  to do a lot of silver mining .###speakerb14.###right.###speakera15.### and, uh, and then actually, north, north of that is  another town and, a smaller, on a smaller scale, i guess, than silverton.### but, i, and then there's lots and lots of real, of mountains that  are covered  with, uh, boulders.###speakerb16.###uh-huh.###speakera17.
96462:59	women	women	are	are capable of  doing the job	women	and so. but i know  some of the other services do not think that women are capable of  doing the job.	###speakera127.###because, i know that there, now there, they want the armed forces to recognize that women can serve in combat roles.###speakerb128.###uh-huh,###uh-huh.###speakera129.###and the only, uh, branch in the armed fo-, services that  seems willing  to do that is the air force.###and, uh, i spoke because women were filing, flying missions into, you know, for whatever reason, into, uh, in the persian gulf war.###speakerb13.###huh.###speakera131.###speakerb132.###yeah,###yeah.###speakera133.
96852:2	reports	medical reports	tell	tell us that women are developing diseases ich now that  used  to be predominately male diseases	reports	and, you know, medical reports tell us that women are developing diseases ich now that  used  to be predominately male diseases.	###but don't you think  it's that way with men too?###i mean, you know, men are sitting behind desks a whole lot more, than they used  to.###speakerb88.###oh, absolutely true### it's, that's true with society, in general,###speakera89.###speakerb9.###speakera91.###yeah,###yeah.###speakerb92.###but specifically the woman's role, in society has changed.###speakera93.###uh-huh.###speakerb94.
96852:33	women	women	are	are developing diseases ich now that  used  to be predominately male diseases	women	and, you know, medical reports tell us that women are developing diseases ich now that  used  to be predominately male diseases.	###but don't you think  it's that way with men too?###i mean, you know, men are sitting behind desks a whole lot more, than they used  to.###speakerb88.###oh, absolutely true### it's, that's true with society, in general,###speakera89.###speakerb9.###speakera91.###yeah,###yeah.###speakerb92.###but specifically the woman's role, in society has changed.###speakera93.###uh-huh.###speakerb94.
9738:9	husbands	husbands	are	are crippled	husbands	that way husbands are crippled,	###that's a part of the problem that women have always had ###and that is  accepting responsibility for things that  really are other people's responsibilities.###speakera171.###that's very true.###speakerb172.### they, they,###speakera173.###and then that way, we have not changed in, hundreds of years, have we .###speakerb174.###speakera175.###speakerb176.###that's right.###speakera177.###yeah.###speakerb178.
97332:43	things	things	work	work out 	things	we are just going  to have,  to see how things work out .	###and so i think, you know,  she will be at a,###i have heard  it's a rough age   to put them into a,###speakerb86.###it is  because that's when they are clinging to mama ,###speakera87.###yeah.###speakerb88.###so you might have a real problem with that.###i think  it, it exp hurts the parents  to leave when the child is crying ,###speakera89.### but, but i think  it,###speakerb9.###so it, you know, it would be ideal if you could get somebody in so you are not really leaving the child in a strange place.###speakera91.###yeah.
97445:36	things	things	work	work out 	things	and so we will just have  to see how things work out .	###speakera129.###speakerb13.###right.###speakera131.###speakerb132.###right.###speakera133.###speakerb134.###uh-huh,###uh-huh.###speakera135.###we might be able  to exchange that way.###speakerb136.###uh-huh.###speakera137.
97451:23	parents	parents	come	come down  to supervise or, whatever	parents	and, uh, you know, parents come down  to supervise or, whatever.	###speakera133.###speakerb134.###uh-huh,###uh-huh.###speakera135.###we might be able  to exchange that way.###speakerb136.###uh-huh.###speakera137.###and so we will just have  to see how things work out .###but i think  the whole, you know, ideally i think, uh,  business should have the, day care centers there, whether it's the parents who  take turns  watching the kids, or whether###speakerb138.###i do too.###speakera139.###they hire a couple of people
9764:23	things	things	are	are changing	things	and, uh, i think  things are changing,	###well i am done  talking.###do you want  to talk?.###speakera53.###well, i think that you carried forth your subject matter very well, uh, nickie.###and i can, uh, relate to that, uh,###speakerb54.###uh-huh.###speakera55.###uh, i think  it's, it's the image that the woman has  and, uh, in the world, as, uh, the lesser of the two.###speakerb56.###uh-huh.###speakera57.###speakerb58.###oh, always.###speakera59.
97657:43	women	women	are	are going  to be able  to have the recognition that they deserve 	women	and, uh, i think that, uh, in the long term that women are going  to be able  to have the recognition that they deserve .	###speakerb6.###uh-huh.###speakera61.###and, uh, i think  we are progressing at a snail's pace,###speakerb62.###indeed.###speakera63.###but we are progressing.###speakerb64.###uh-huh.###speakera65.###so, that's the main point is that we are going ahead.###speakerb66.###uh-huh.###speakera67.
97834:74	women	women	go	go	women	well, oh, from a woman's point of view and it was very, uh, chauvinistic as far as women go.	###speakera143.###and it's, it's just marvelous,###and i am just in awe  to see this,###speakera1.###well, what movies have you seen  recently, valerie?###speakerb2.### let's see,###the last one  we saw  was thelma and louise.###speakera3.###oh, we haven't seen that one yet.###speakerb4.###well,  don't bother.###speakera5.###oh, it wasn't that good.###speakerb6.
98217:2	fathers	fathers	are	are just missing, you know	fathers	or, or fathers are just missing, you know,	###speakera12.###uh-huh.###speakerb13.###you know, and i think  most of that is because their parents aren't around.###that make sense?###speakera14.###yeah.###speakerb15.###yeah.###speakera16.### that, uh, the, what they call  the latchkey children.###speakerb17.###yeah,###something like that.###no one's, you know,
98427:14	people	people	are	are well indoctrinated  in their society that drunken driving is unacceptable	people	 is that people are well indoctrinated  in their society that drunken driving is unacceptable.	###but nowadays, there's so much on tv where, where people seem  to have the idea  they can get something for nothing .###of course uh, i work for lawyers a lot###speakerb95.###uh-huh.###speakera96.###and i see,  unfortunately, we have this whole mentality that somehow there are these pots of money out there that you can sue somebody and, you know, there's a million dollars  you can have  uh, for mental duress or whatever  .###speakerb97.###uh-huh.###speakera98.###speakerb99.###yeah.###speakera1.###but, you know, the other thing that  bothers me in the crime is the, uh,###in europe, they seem  to have mentality,###and drunk driving is a good one,
98639:28	juries	juries	have	have a right  to know more	juries	and, uh, i don't know that juries have a right  to know more because in a sense we call those safeguards,	###speakerb41.###right.###speakera42.###if it's first degree rape, second deg-, degree rape or whatever, they only get  to decide on that,###well, okay this person has been charged  with first degree rape, uh,###and you can decide guilt or innocence on that.###speakerb43.###uh-huh.###speakera44.###uh, such like, maybe in murder they get  to choose whether it's, uh, premeditated or one or two of the lesser degrees.###the other thing that juries are restricted  on  and, and at least to me this has been one of the frustrating things in my, even in my own experiences, that you usually don't get  to hear all the information.###speakerb45.###yeah.###speakera46.###it's what information  is presented 
112:29	people	elderly people	do	don't realize that their diet is that bad	people	so often i think though,   elderly people don't realize that their diet is that bad.	###speakerb18.###and she got kind of fearful of  being on her own.###she never really ate very well.###it was one thing.###she hardly ever took care of herself###speakera19.###yeah.###speakerb2.###and she didn't eat.###she ate very poor###so i think  she was, you know,###bad, uh, nutrition on top of it.###and, uh, she got to the point  she didn't want  to alone anymore.###so,###speakera21.
147:4	people	people	do	don't want  to try  to figure out little bitty individual meals	people	people don't want  to try  to figure out little bitty individual meals.	###speakerb3.###oh really?###speakera31.###yeah.###uh-huh.###speakerb32.###well she didn't want  to cook for herself anymore.###speakera33.###yeah.###speakerb34.###oh, that's too much trouble.###that's too much trouble.### didn't want  to cook.###speakera35.###and the portions,
1663:67	kids	kids	are	are, you know, at a tougher and rougher age	kids	and they said, oh, but we need more in the middle school because that's when kids are, you know, at a tougher and rougher age and all that .	###huh.###speakerb52.###speakera53.###yeah.###speakerb54.###and that's overwhelming.###speakera55.###well we've got, uh, you know at our school we have over a thousand elementary kids###and last year was the first year that we ever had more than one counselor .###and that's just really not enough.###speakerb56.###no.###it isn't .###speakera57.###and i was talking to somebody that  teaches in a middle school
1948:38	schools	plano schools	do	do so little of that. that if they hadn't had it before they hit first grade they were never going  to have any art or music or any of the interpretive stuff	schools	and i'm really glad  my kids had it because plano schools do so little of that. that if they hadn't had it before they hit first grade they were never going  to have any art or music or any of the interpretive stuff.	###speakera42.###she went back as a teenager###and these people that  had changed her diapers when she was three  were still there.###speakerb43.###oh, my gosh.###speakera44.###so, it, it was really neat.###but it was because they had a director that  had always done it as a labor of love###and she just kept good people and real cheerful place, lots of arts and crafts,###speakerb45.###uh-huh.###speakera46.###speakerb47.###oh my goodness.###speakera48.
1185:14	people	people	are	are starting  to give up hope	people	it's like people are starting  to give up hope	###speakera32.###speakerb33.###like a lot,###it seems like the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer, is even more, true today. you know?###speakera34.###speakerb35.###speakera36.###yeah,###there is a a big difference in the, uh, economic, um, status of, uh, people although i think  that has been true, uh, always.###speakerb37.###s-,###speakera38.###um, perhaps there's less of the middle range then there was .###speakerb39.###yeah.
11884:4	people	people	have	have become very selfish	people	people have become very selfish.	###i mean even if they had  to pay more now, i mean in the long run it exp's going  to cost society more  to force two people to work. even though it's higher productivity is short-term.###speakera62.###that's right.###speakerb63.###speakera64.### it's already, it already costs society much more because of it.###speakerb65.###speakera66.###you know it,### trying  to do all these programs like headstart and things like those. you wouldn't have  to do that if mothers would stay home with their children and do things with them, you know.###speakerb67.###yeah.###speakera68.###um, there's,###and i think, uh,  a lot of it is selfishness.
1282:17	things	things	backfire	backfire	things	and once in a while things backfire.	###speakerb4.###uh-huh.###speakera41.###and, uh, their pastas were great.###speakerb42.### tha-, that's one of the things, a good pasta means a lot to me.### i, i like different kinds of food.###so, when we go out , i'm always looking for something other than the standard menu, even if, it's a mexican restaurant, like something other than, uh, you know the standard tacos, enchiladas, tamales and fajitas now.###speakera43.###speakerb44.###speakera45.###you're brave.###speakerb46.###yes,###yes
1311:22	people	people	are	are just petrified, at least some are , at the thought of nuclear	people	it's kind of funny because people are just petrified, at least some are , at the thought of nuclear.	###yeah.###speakerb32.###what 's interesting, several years ago, i took a course, uh, on, uh,###well, it was actually, it was put  on by the power companies and, about the various sources of energy and how much pollution there was , and there wasn't  from various kinds of, of energy.###and, uh, at that point in time, one person that  was a speaker brought up the topic of acid rain###and it was kind of pooh-poohed , you know.###oh, you're making a mountain out of a molehill, kind of thing.###and it's turned out that, that's been very true, what he was forecasting  about the accumulation of, of the pollutants in the air and the acid rain and what it would do  to foliage.###so, it's kind of interesting the change in perspective from when i took that course .###now, a lot of people are really afraid of nuclear.###uh, i'm not afraid of nuclear,  having had that course because of how the nuclear that, uh, they use  is not bomb quality ,###and, we're so strict with all our controls ich in the united states.  the chances of, of an accident are slight,###and, it doesn't pollute the air at all.###it exp's safer ich  to be around a nuclear plant then it exp is   to be around a coal plant.###many more deaths ich have occurred in rnr and  dealing with rnr coal plants then ever around nuclear plants.
13451:14	people	people	find	find ways around	people	you know, people find ways around.	###speakera78.###right.###speakerb79.###but, uh, i don't know.###it's just,###speakera8.###well, i was, i saw on a human interest story, or whatever today,  there was a woman who  was just being paroled  and trying  to make it back,###she was off drugs and everything,###speakerb81.###uh-huh.###speakera82.###but she said, uh, you know,  in prison you can get anything.###you can any drugs  you want .###there's,### it, it's just like  being outside.
13983:18	drinkers	beer drinkers	are	are among the worst for  throwing things out the window	drinkers	and it seems like beer drinkers are among the worst for  throwing things out the window	###speakera33.###right.###speakerb34.###but on the plastic, i have, uh, i don't have any habits there yet###and i'm,  guess  i'm waiting for the city to, to push me in that direction### but, but, it just seems like on the larger scale that, you know, the, we always talk about  in our society is that economic strife things###speakera35.###well, i guess  they will  shortly.###i, uh,###speakerb36.###and i think if, uh, if we just start  to put, you know, the nickel deposit on things, like, uh,  was the case years ago that, uh, it would have more immediate ich effect, uh, than,###because i remember  searching ditches for beer bottles because they were worth money###speakera37.###oh, right.###speakerb38.
1448:3	kids	kids	do	don't appreciate, maybe the value of money	kids	i, i think  kids don't appreciate, maybe the value of money, that it's so little that they don't care,	###we live next to a set of railroad tracks###and it exp seemed  to be a very popular thing for people driving by that highway there, by our tracks to throw the bottles at the tracks and try  to crash, you know break them,###speakerb3.###uh-huh.###speakera31.###but, uh, they weren't that successful,###so there were a lot of bottles   to be returned ###and we just walk about a half a mile in each direction and gathered up enough  to buy whatever we wanted  for the day###speakerb32.###uh-huh.###speakera33.###and,###speakerb34.###yeah,###and they, uh, p-,
14742:9	men	men	have	have been dying from prostate cancer for years	men	and yet men have been dying from prostate cancer for years.	###so  let's give money to aids.###and yet we've had breast cancer problems for years.###speakerb4.###right.###speakera5.###and, it's just### one of those, uh, course, one of the shows  i saw  was taking it from the angle that, since it doesn't effect men, it's not going  to get funded .###and, uh,  having thought about that for a while,###speakerb6.###what did you think  about that idea?###speakera7.###well, i, i kind of, i thought, well, that, that might be possible since there are a lot of men in control of that kind of thing.###but then i got, i got to  thinking,  the, the number one killer of men seems  to be the prostate###and there's only one test that  just recently got developed , uh, a blood in-, antigen, uh, antibody test for the antigen in the blood###and that's fairly recent.

13779:198	people	people	tend	tend  to do it	people	what, what  really works, uh, at least down here is, if there is, if there is some, e-, even some money   basically to take care of the gas   to recycle it  , you know what i mean , then people tend  to do it.	###well, shoot, maybe what we ought  to do  is  start  sending unsmashed, uh, pepsi cans and whatever up there.###speakera46.###yeah.###speakerb47.###speakera48.###exactly,###yeah,### send it to this address,###no.###speakerb49.###speakera5.###but, uh,  let's see,###they said that, how, ways,  can encourage recycling, uh,###speakerb51.### i, i, i tell you
131139:18	women	women	get	get maternity leave and stuff like that	women	but, you know, women get maternity leave and stuff like that	### i, and especially, i think   with women increasingly working, they're going  to have  to demand more from men.###speakerb22.###speakera23.###speakerb24.###uh-huh.###speakera25.###because there is just, i-, impossible  to keep up on everything else.###speakerb26.###yeah,###yeah.###speakera27.###have more of an active role in  taking care of children, more of an active role in  taking care of the home.###speakerb28.###well, you know, they've been talking about###and i don't know, uh, what the status ich is  on it,
131254:49	women	men and women	are	are equal	women	i don't think  they're ever going  to prove that men and women are equal.	###i mean i'm not a women's libber by any means,###but i do,###speakera71.###right.###speakerb72.###there are issues that, you know, as far as, like, equal pay for men and women and that kind of stuff, i totally am for .###speakera73.###right.###speakerb74.###but, i don't get into the, uh, the real women libber movement, you know.###speakera75.###no,###i don't either.###speakerb76.###speakera77.

131756:4	lessons	lessons	do	do help	lessons	lessons do help.	###speakera29.###oh, really?###speakerb3.###yeah,### i, i think  i need  to, uh,###speakera31.###yeah.###speakerb32.###i probably need  to take some, some more lessons, uh, more current and, uh, and practice more often.###speakera33.###yeah.###speakerb34.###spend more time on the,###speakera35.###i think  i'm probably the same way.
132445:9	things	things	are	are kind of hectic at school	things	if things are kind of hectic at school and people are running late, they kind of wait on us.	###speakerb59.###i have twenty-five minutes for lunch.###speakera6.###yeah.###speakerb61.###that is out for me.###speakera62.###that doesn't really do it, does it?###speakerb63.###no,###i don't think so.###speakera64.###yeah.###speakerb65.### but, uh, and they are nice because if we are running late, it usually, uh,
132445:32	people	people	are	are running late	people	if things are kind of hectic at school and people are running late, they kind of wait on us.	###speakerb59.###i have twenty-five minutes for lunch.###speakera6.###yeah.###speakerb61.###that is out for me.###speakera62.###that doesn't really do it, does it?###speakerb63.###no,###i don't think so.###speakera64.###yeah.###speakerb65.### but, uh, and they are nice because if we are running late, it usually, uh,
132573:164	taxes	taxes	are	are supposed  to be directed  towards 	taxes	well, i think that, uh, that the problem with the sales tax, of course, is  it's an unfair tax across the board, uh, as far as ability  to pay, which a-, allegedly, allegedly taxes are supposed  to be directed  towards .	###speakera9.###that's right.###speakerb1.###speakera11.###that's right.###speakerb12.###and actually, that one, the, the, the taxes on gasoline don't, don't bug me as much as, uh, uh, what are we , eight and a quarter percent sales tax?###speakera13.###yep,###that's right.###speakerb14.###and every time  you go  to buy anything now , uh,###even, you know, they, they tax food.###that's the one that  really kind of bothers me.###speakera15.
13262:41	people	people	think	think twice on  putting their money into that, i guess  , you know, unless they really want it	people	and the idea of that kind of taxation is  to have people think twice on  putting their money into that, i guess  , you know, unless they really want it,	###speakera25.###and, uh, i guess  if people got thirty, forty thousand bucks   to spend  on a car, uh, that's their prerogative, you know.### i, i, i don't have a whole of sympathy on that.### you, maybe you buy that, you know,###and i don't mean  to be knocking, uh,###speakerb26.###no,###uh, no,###i haven't ,###but it, it to me it exp seems really interesting that they come along and add another ten percent tax, uh, on top of it.###and there's an awful lot of cars that  cost more than thirty thousand.###speakera27.###yeah,###there are ,###there are .
133543:15	things	things	get	get completely out of control	things	but then when things get completely out of control and it basically hits bottom , that's aids	###and he is now in full-blown aids,  really not doing very well, and has a brain tumor or some-, that sort of thing.###speakera46.###yeah,###it sounds awful.###speakerb47.###yeah,### it's, it's a very nasty thing.###speakera48.###is it just that the immune system ceases  to function properly###and,###speakerb49.###um, yeah,### that's, that's basically it, that, um, the immune system can at first slow down,###and the white blood cell count goes down,### which  is, that's aids related complex,
133547:26	people	people	are	are prone to  getting any kind of, you know, weird cancer that only animals got  before	people	and in that case, you know, people are prone to  getting any kind of, you know, weird cancer that only animals got  before	###speakerb47.###yeah,### it's, it's a very nasty thing.###speakera48.###is it just that the immune system ceases  to function properly###and,###speakerb49.###um, yeah,### that's, that's basically it, that, um, the immune system can at first slow down,###and the white blood cell count goes down,### which  is, that's aids related complex,###but then when things get completely out of control and it basically hits bottom , that's aids###speakera5.###and,###speakerb51.
133598:144	people	people	have	have  to pay less money in taxes	people	my understanding is  what they're try-, what, what supposedly they're trying  to do  by  reducing taxes is  to kind of jump start the economy, the idea being that if people have  to pay less money in taxes, they'll have more money   to spend , uh,	###it can only hurt the deficit picture.###speakerb13.###yeah,###exactly.###speakera14.###um, and the, the severity of the deficit picture already limits the options available or limits the degree of tax cutting  you can do  without, uh,  bringing on, on serious problems for the longer term.###speakerb15.###yeah,###exactly.###speakera16.###so that, that, that's the current predicament.###speakerb17.###yeah,###it see-, seems like it's, it's a kind of a catch twenty-two.###i mean, it's, it's the, um,
133648:53	people	people	have	have borrowed 	people	also somewhat mumblex is  to collect owed  to the government from various loan programs that people have borrowed .	###i don't know,###what kind of things do you think   can be done  in, in, uh, in the long term?###speakera3.###mumblex well,  can be done  or  will be done  are two different things.###um, at various places   to look  for, for  cutting the budget, first of all i consider more defense cuts than  are already planned  depending on the world situation.###speakerb31.###sure.###speakera32.###but there are various other areas such as, as farm subsidies that  ought  to be slashed .###uh, a lot of entitlement programs, like education aid, i think, uh,  they should put a, in###the reagan administration took all such entitlements to the poor but left them for the middle class, uh,###speakerb33.###uh-huh.###speakera34.###in the longer term, uh, we, we, we'd do well, i think    to make, to make, uh, reductions there.
135461:38	things	things	are	are different	things	well, it makes you understand that, you know, things are different.	### it, and it's funny because the one  i have , every single month without fail she has babies.###speakerb124.###you're kidding.###speakera125.###oh, no.###all the time,###and, um, i,###and she's supposed  to,###her variety, it says  they won't eat the babies,###and i've seen her do it.###so.###speakerb126.###and that just makes you sick almost, doesn't it ?###speakera127.###oh, it's ter-,
13626:23	people	people	are	are fascinated  by other people that they think   are strange 	people	isn't it exp strange how people are fascinated  by other people that they think   are strange ?	###speakerb8.###um, that's on at,  let's see, it's on at four.###speakera81.###oh, okay.###i'm not home then,###that's why i don't see it .###speakerb82.###yeah,###i'll watch that occasionally.###he's got some real,###i don't know,###there's some real weird people that, he seems  to come up with .###speakera83.###speakerb84.###speakera85.
136843:7	people	people	are	are not sitting in front of that	people	usually people are not sitting in front of that.	###no.###in fact in, i think  if people would learn  to turn off the t v --s###and###speakerb94.###uh-huh.###yeah.###speakera95.###i think  that's a lot of the breakdown of the communication and the communication that  would take place in a family,###speakerb96.###yes,###yeah.###speakera97.###speakerb98.###which  is,###speakera99.
137655:11	fans	football fans	are	are probably the most fickle people in the world	fans	uh, football fans are probably the most fickle people in the world.	###and so pretty fast turnaround.###but this year they made it to playoffs###and today was  the first game###and they beat the chicago bears###so everybody's really going crazy, you know, down here.###speakerb22.###i'll bet  they are .###speakera23.###they're going crazy,### so, so they turned it around,###but, you know, they have a lot of young exciting players now, uh,###i mean, everybody was real upset, you know, when they fired tom landry ,###but, you know, now it's like, you know, they're doing good###so everybody's forgotten about that.###speakerb24.
13775:75	teams	teams	jell	jell together	teams	course, i think, you know,  you can't really go by what  happened earlier in the season because teams jell together or they've had injuries that  heal	###well, it's supposed  to be the redskins,###but you know, we beat them already.###we beat them this year in, in washington### so, you know, so everybody has the feeling like we can go all the way to the super bowl,###but, you know, it's just that we have  to play every game away, you know,###it's going  to be tough,### but, but every-,###the competition is, are teams that they've already beat  this year,###so, i mean, atlanta, they're in it, too,###and we beat them###and, uh, see, detroit, we play them next week,###but, you know, we should beat them.###everybody feels like we should be able  to beat them### so, it's, so everything's, uh, looking real good.###speakerb4.
137933:16	people	people	go	go, what's this stuff 	people	if it does, people go, what's this stuff .	###speakera49.###yeah.###speakerb5.###speakera51.###yeah,###uh, shoot###speakerb52.### mississippi probably doesn't, mississippi probably doesn't have  to worry too much.###speakera53.###some of these muddy driveways could use it around here.###speakerb54.###speakera55.###no,###snow doesn't happen very often.###speakerb56.
138151:46	students	students	do	don't seem  to show that respect	students	and, uh,  exp makes me a little nervous that, uh, students don't seem  to show that respect	###you're just getting  started.###speakera35.###speakerb36.###speakera37.###i'm just, starting her,###speakerb38.###speakera39.###but, uh,  seems to me that, uh, kids these days, uh, can really get away with murder###and the teachers don't have as much, aren't respected  as much###and, uh, they have  to be so careful of the things  they do and say .###speakerb4.###yeah,###i know.###that's a big problem.###speakera41.
138199:21	kids	kids	are	are not the same ich now as they used  to be 	kids	so i mean, obviously, kids are not the same ich now as they used  to be .	###for other people###speakerb56.###speakera57.###and,###speakerb58.###and so then you wind up with little brats on your hands.###speakera59.###well, how do you think that that's happened ?###you think  our society's just, uh, stopped  talking out,###or this, uh generation's just kind of changed a little bit, uh,###speakerb6.###i guess,  i,###speakera61.###speakerb62.###well, the world changes,
138857:6	people	people	are	are really upset about that when it comes to their rights and their rights being violated  	people	and people are really upset about that when it comes to their rights and their rights being violated  .	###speakera8.###same sort of problem that  happens sometimes is these, some of these, uh, like aids tests and such.###speakerb9.###okay.###speakera1.###speakerb11.###uh-huh,###yeah,###that's right,###i have heard,###uh, i don't remember what they call it , sort of like a positive, negatives or some, some kind of word  they use  when a, uh, you get a, uh, a positive indication of drugs , but there's not really, there weren't really any there .###speakera12.###yeah.###speakerb13.###uh, every now and then there's an error
138913:6	bottles	bottles	get	get mixed  up, things like that	bottles	and bottles get mixed  up, things like that.	###it,###as each employee comes in part of the hiring procedure is a, a blood test.###uh,###speakerb29.###uh-huh.###speakera3.###but mumblex i think  the big problem, though, is, is  they send these off to large labs###speakerb31.###b-,###speakera32.###speakerb33.###uh-huh,###right.###speakera34.###and then they have thousands and thousands of samples that, uh, going through it in a day
13991:13	things	things	are	are getting warm again	things	then by march things are getting warm again,	### still could come,###huh.###speakerb13.###generally if we're going  to get them, it's not going  to happen, uh, prior to january one.###speakera14.###uh-huh.###speakerb15.###you may get a cold snap or two or some rain or something like  we've been getting  in december,###but usually the bitterest weather, if we're going  to have any, comes in january and february.###speakera16.###yeah.###speakerb17.###speakera18.###um.###speakerb19.
139264:6	things	things	do	do happen severely a few times a year	things	and things do happen severely a few times a year,	###well, it's based  here,###uh, the international headquarters for wycliff bible translators is right here in, in dallas.###speakerb93.###so you're, you're with the home office now.###speakera94.###yeah,###right now i am .###that's what  brought me here,###yeah.###speakerb95.###well, the, uh, i think, uh,  all in all there are a lot worse climates than dallas, uh,###the weather you know, does change fast###speakera96.###yeah.###speakerb97.
139533:3	couples	three or four couples	come	come over	couples	and have, you know, like three or four couples come over,	###well i'm planning a,###and naturally this is appropriate because i'm planning dinner for people tomorrow night and then the next night.###speakerb37.###oh.###speakera38.###speakerb39.###oh, good.###speakera4.###so tuesday night there'll be eight people here altogether.###speakerb41.###uh, actually one thing  we have done  quite a bit through the holidays, just because it's a, real easy, is just baked potato dinners.###speakera42.###oh, yeah,###uh-huh.###speakerb43.
141184:4	people	people	are	are, real sports conscious	people	people are, real sports conscious and really get involved with their kids, sports activities and,	###uh-huh.###speakerb54.###speakera55.###yeah.###speakerb56.###i think, you know,  it exp's very, very easy  to fall into that trap,###and i'm not, um, totally innocent of that because, there's times when you just stay here, watch a tape .###speakera57.###uh-huh.###speakerb58.###speakera59.###yeah.###speakerb6.###but, um, um, i think  different parts of the country,###i think  in plano and maybe this area in texas, there's a lot of community activities that parents could join in  with their kids.
141197:9	families	families	are	are facing a challenge	families	well, families are facing a challenge,	###but, um, um, i think  different parts of the country,###i think  in plano and maybe this area in texas, there's a lot of community activities that parents could join in  with their kids.###people are, real sports conscious and really get involved with their kids, sports activities and,###speakera61.###uh-huh.###speakerb62.###speakera63.###oh, that's good.###speakerb64.###you know, but, um,###speakera65.###yeah.###speakerb66.###speakera67.###yeah,
142183:4	lessons	lessons	are	are expensive though	lessons	lessons are expensive though.	###speakerb44.###yeah.###speakera45.###but i###speakerb46.###oh well that sounds like fun too.###speakera47.###but my golf clubs will probably rust before i get  to use them again###because my boys are still right at the beginning age###and it is probably going  to be six to eight years before they go to college.###speakerb48.###uh-huh.###well, you need  to, uh, teach them how  to play  and take them out on the course with you.###speakera49.###that's right.
142815:9	rollers	rollers	are	are so messy	rollers	uh. rollers are so messy.	###it was like over two hundred dollars worth of free stuff.###speakera115.###oh, my word.###speakerb116.###speakera117.###oh, my word.###well, he really saved in that way.###speakerb118.###yeah.###speakera119.###but, yeah,###i think  we are going  to do, uh, another bathroom,###but i think  i will probably just do it, in a roller.###i want  to do it  about the same color. and just be a little,###speakerb12.
143528:27	women	women	seem	seem  to like  to look a lot more than men do	women	then i'd go  look because women seem  to like  to look a lot more than men do.	###speakera75.###but they always seemed  to get along fine, you know.###speakerb76.###oh, yeah,###yeah.###i think  once we get into a place, it will be just fine,###but you know, it's until then, it exp's, uh, oh, a little stressful, you know,  just looking all the time and that sort of thing.###speakera77.###oh, sure.###speakerb78.###speakera79.###oh, i know###and it's, there's nothing harder than that.###i always just sort of a, assign my wife that chore,###then i would let her narrow it down to three or four,
143528:66	men	men	do	do	men	then i'd go  look because women seem  to like  to look a lot more than men do.	###speakera75.###but they always seemed  to get along fine, you know.###speakerb76.###oh, yeah,###yeah.###i think  once we get into a place, it will be just fine,###but you know, it's until then, it exp's, uh, oh, a little stressful, you know,  just looking all the time and that sort of thing.###speakera77.###oh, sure.###speakerb78.###speakera79.###oh, i know###and it's, there's nothing harder than that.###i always just sort of a, assign my wife that chore,###then i would let her narrow it down to three or four,
143651:11	systems	school systems	are	are, in too many states, dominated  by administrators	systems	uh, school systems are, in too many states, dominated  by administrators	###speakerb24.###well you can, you can tell me a little bit more about it because i don't think  we did that in utah.###speakera25.###well, the cooperative learning is a technique that  was tried  initially  to integrate the public schools.###and, uh, what, what it involves , basically, is the use of peer groups###and the, uh, teacher becomes a, uh, a sort of a consultant, resource person to the cooperative learning, uh, to the learning cooperatives, i guess  they're called  rnr.###speakerb26.###uh-huh.###speakera27.###and there are, uh, some fairly sophisticated approaches that  are used  in the high schools with point systems and things like that so that people, uh, gain a competence with respect to the material.###speakerb28.###uh-huh.###speakera29.###uh, i think that the combination of, uh, technology and techniques like that together with marketplace forces will bring about a revolution in the way  we learn .###uh, i think  there is a direct threat to vested interest in the public school system, uh, that  will stand in the way of that progress being a little faster.
14418:14	people	people	lie	lie	people	you know, people lie,	###you were assumed  guilty until proven  innocent###and once they found you guilty, you know, judge said, he's guilty,### kill him.###well, th-, there were some people that, uh, that  had a problem with that. because they found out later on that, jeez, you know, a guy will lie rather than get killed .###speakera48.###uh-huh.###speakerb49.###speakera5.###right.###speakerb51.###and he'll say, you know, hey, that guy ich did it, you know, not me.###speakera52.###yeah.###speakerb53.### and, uh, or he'll have somebody lie for him.

16318:4	criminals	criminals	have	have none of these things	criminals	criminals have none of these things.	###that may very well be.###speakerb12.### i, i hold it in the utmost contempt.###speakera13.###uh,###speakerb14.### the, uh, d-, my favorite is the police department,###they're not aimed  at the criminal.###the judicial system is aimed  at the citizens###because you and i, we have work schedules,###we can be called  at work,###we have social security numbers,###they can trace us down,###we have telephones,###then we have checkbooks.
163741:22	people	people	keep	keep their money	people	or you can hope that if people keep their money that they'll spend more and create jobs and, and whatnot.	###at least at the end.###speakera31.###uh-huh.###i mean, i don't know,###i,###speakerb32.###yeah,### i-, i-, they were very good at first,###they were in very good financials at first###and, uh, that's part of the reason  he became a nominee  is because things went so well.###and then, of course, the bottom fell out.###speakera33.### it's, uh, i mean, it's, it's tough.###i mean, there's, there's two ways  you can kind of go   to get out of tough financial situations.###i guess  you can like raise taxes and then create like job programs and whatnot
16398:64	things	things	are	are working now 	things	so it's, it's, it exp's really backwards how things are working now 	### you hear a, you hear a paula abdul song###and you,###and i think,  if somebody else were  to play that, you know, they wouldn't, they, nobody, everybody would think, that's lousy,###but because she did it, it's supposed  to be good, you know,###it comes to the point where it's your name, not what you do   more than anything.###speakera53.###right.###speakerb54.###madonna can do anything###and it would be considered  good because it's madonna, you know.###speakera55.###right.###speakerb56.###madonna could start  playing folk music###and folk music would be huge just because madonna does it,
16498:95	people	people	leave	leave the door open, you know, while they're upstairs  playing music	people	and, they could, uh, they could get in pretty easy and, and especially, uh, since there are bedrooms upstairs and people leave the door open, you know, while they're upstairs  playing music,	###speakerb3.###right.###speakera31.###but, even so, it, i mean, it's, it exp's still difficult for me to convince my apartment mates to, to like lock the doors when they go out , you know, and things like that.###speakerb32.###yeah.###speakera33.###speakerb34.###uh-huh.###speakera35.###uh, it exp would be so easy for someone who  is motivated  to do so to just, you know, sit out back, take a look at when people are here  and when they're not   just come in, you know,###speakerb36.###uh-huh.###speakera37.###there's a t v and a v c r
16419:25	eights	v eights	seem	seem  to be a return to the days of, you know, ten or twelve miles a gallon	eights	and, uh, you know, v eights seem  to be a return to the days of, you know, ten or twelve miles a gallon.	###speakerb26.###sure.###speakera27.###something that  will carry it around careful, i guess   is best, best way   to describe it .###right now, we've got a v six###and it, that seems  to be just fine.###i know  they s-, they're coming out with some v eight now###and i think  that's probably a little over kill for this day and age.###speakerb28.###yeah,###i was surprised  to hear that the v eights are coming back,###so, they've got some pretty powerful sixes.###speakera29.###uh-huh.###speakerb3.
164292:11	people	so many people	use	use it	people	i, i, i wonder if, uh, if drug use is a more prevalent crime, though, because, i mean, so many people use it,	###so i know  i'd be happy with a, a reasonable, uh, four door.###you know, again, we've, we've got the same issue with  getting kids into the,###speakera1.###what kind of crime do you think, uh,   is the most prevalent in our society?###speakerb2.###oh, boy, probably, uh, robberies, people stealing from each other.###speakera3.###such as new york city?###speakerb4.###is that what  happens up there a lot?###uh, th-, that, that's mostly what i hear , though, is people getting ripped  off and things getting stolen .###that's the most prevalent crime. uh, the ones that  really, you know, the ones that  really add up after a while, i guess, you know, from, s-, far as insurance money and stuff like that, insurance costs.###you know, everybody has  to pay for it indirectly eventually.###speakera5.###yeah,
16632:9	people	people	are	aren't really, you know, eco conscious 	people	where people aren't really, you know, eco conscious . it's just the fact that it's something  they have  to do .	###well, here they and,###uh,  live in an apartment complex.###speakera5.###uh-huh.###speakerb6.###and they only have one set of recycling bins, one or two sets as opposed to a set at each of the dumpsters.###so a lot of the people who  live up front don't bother  to recycle because, you know, it exp's too far  to carry the stuff to the other bins.###speakera7.### i, i know  a lot, i think  a lot of, uh, the, the issues with regard to recycling are that, uh, people have  to be motivated  to do, to do something like that because it does take extra effort.###whether### and, and i think that, and i know  massachusetts has,###a bottle bill was passed ###and we have had a bottle bill for quite a few years now,###and the majority of the incentive in  recycling bottles probably,  believe it or not, is just  to get the extra nickel at the, uh, the store and not, uh,###that's the majority of people that i know of  anyways.
1664:13	people	people	need	need  to be more conscious of it	people	but, uh, people need  to be more conscious of it.	### i, i know  a lot, i think  a lot of, uh, the, the issues with regard to recycling are that, uh, people have  to be motivated  to do, to do something like that because it does take extra effort.###whether### and, and i think that, and i know  massachusetts has,###a bottle bill was passed ###and we have had a bottle bill for quite a few years now,###and the majority of the incentive in  recycling bottles probably,  believe it or not, is just  to get the extra nickel at the, uh, the store and not, uh,###that's the majority of people that i know of  anyways.###where people aren't really, you know, eco conscious . it's just the fact that it's something  they have  to do .###and i'm not going  to throw a bottle away,###it's like  throwing a nickel away.###that type of thing.###speakerb8.###right.### they, th-, here they're trying  to push through a bill###speakera9.
16679:8	books	phone books	are	are a large volume of annual trash	books	and phone books are a large volume of annual trash.	###yeah.###speakerb16.###speakera17.### th-, there definitely has  to be a motivation factor###and i know that, at w-, where i work ,###i work for a defense contractor.###and there's a big push on for  recycling, uh, paper materials, you know, computer output paper and also  to decrease the amount of, uh, styrofoam usage because of the, uh, the process involved in styrofoam and, and the whole eco issue and that.### and, and they're very proactive###and, uh, matter of fact, they give you discounts if you use, uh, china wear rather than, uh, styrofoam stuff,### so. so, i-, i-, it's incentives like that that  get people people more conscious of it.###i think  that's, that's what they need  to do .  be more proactive like that.###speakerb18.###uh, i know, uh, i believe  it was last year that they actually collected the old phone books .### uh, usually have them come from mumblex you know, projects  to collect old ones.### usually just get dumped  out with the trash.
16618:36	changes	social changes	go	go 	changes	well, i would say  as, far as social changes go , uh, i think   families were more together.	###speakerb22.###they contain the glue and stuff###and they used  to have  to take out all the, uh, pages and then cut the spine off  to be able  to recycle them.###speakera23.###yeah.###speakerb24.###now i think  they've come up with some way of, uh,  pulling the glue out.###speakera25.###yeah.###okay.###speakera1.###uh,  let's see.###how about, uh,  let's see, about ten years ago,###uh, what do you think   was different ich ten years ago from now?###speakerb2.
166168:85	families	families	are	are concerned	families	it's just a matter where priorities are, at placed  . and that, uh, usually as far as families are concerned, there used  to be just one person working and usually the other parent was home.	###i'm twenty-eight.###speakerb22.###twenty-eight.###okay,###i'm twenty-three.###speakera23.###yeah.###speakerb24.###so there's maybe a five year gap between us.###speakera25.###yeah.###speakerb26.###so, uh.###speakera27.### i just, i think that things were a bit, were, have been busy all along.
166244:11	people	people	want	want all of that	people	but, uh people want all of that	###speakerb58.###uh-huh.###speakera59.###speakerb6.###okay.###speakera61.###so.###i mean i have met people that, uh, both that, that  just want  to maintain a, the standard of living and those that, that  really need the job.###speakerb62.###okay.###and then, sometimes i, i often, uh, find that maybe there's so many different things available to us. yo-, a microwave, a v c r, a answering machine a, you know, a special, a dishwasher, uh, a refrigerator and some of those items, um, for the, for the, uh,###speakera63.###uh-huh.###speakerb64.###well i guess  we're sticking more to social changes
167132:4	corporations	corporations	have	have  to 	corporations	corporations have  to ,	###is pennsylvania kind of out of line there?###speakera2.###well, actually, i don't think  they're out of line.### de-, devil's advocate possibly,###but it, you are trying  to avoid  paying taxes###and whe-, whether or not you agree with that law, i-, you're still circumventing it.###you are legal in, in your circumvention of that law.###speakerb3.### what, what if you're not doing it in order  to circumvent the law though?###i mean what if you don't even realize that you're subject to  paying, uh, income tax on something that you purchase  mail order?###speakera4.###really, i, i, i don't think  that's a valid argument.###i think that most people are quite aware  they're not paying that six percent sales tax.###um, s-, s-, naturally some, some things you just can't find  in your local k-mart or, or, uh, bryn mawr stereo dealer.###uh, but th-, th-, th-, then why  not pay, pay the sales tax  mumblex.
167158:22	businesses	businesses	do	do  at the present	businesses	which  is exactly what businesses do  at the present.	### i don't, i don't think that that's my responsibility as a, as a conscientious consumer.###speakera8.### i, i'll agree  it, it's not your responsibility### but, b-, is it exp also legal, for you to do that?###speakerb9.###speakera1.### w-, w-, fr-, from what i understand  from v-, v-, various net readings, i-, i-, it, the federal government is going  to try  to legislate a more aggressive enforcement of state tax schemes, uh, in, into place in the next few years.### it is, it is a lost revenue stream right now###and states c-, can use all the revenue  they can get .### with some, with something like that, d-, do your arguments still apply?###speakerb11.###well, i think that if, if policy is established  rnr and if a mechanism is put  into place rnr  to promote the collection of taxes in this fashion, then i don't argue with it.###because it exp's not a burden on the consumer  to remember that oh, i bought this out of state.###i need  to xerox the receipt and make out a check for six percent and send it to pennsylvania.###speakera12.
167161:29	businesses	businesses	do	do that	businesses	but  the point is  is that businesses do that.	### but, b-, is it exp also legal, for you to do that?###speakerb9.###speakera1.### w-, w-, fr-, from what i understand  from v-, v-, various net readings, i-, i-, it, the federal government is going  to try  to legislate a more aggressive enforcement of state tax schemes, uh, in, into place in the next few years.### it is, it is a lost revenue stream right now###and states c-, can use all the revenue  they can get .### with some, with something like that, d-, do your arguments still apply?###speakerb11.###well, i think that if, if policy is established  rnr and if a mechanism is put  into place rnr  to promote the collection of taxes in this fashion, then i don't argue with it.###because it exp's not a burden on the consumer  to remember that oh, i bought this out of state.###i need  to xerox the receipt and make out a check for six percent and send it to pennsylvania.###speakera12.###which  is exactly what businesses do  at the present.###speakerb13.###right.

169216:21	people	people	are	are pretty conscientious about it	people	i think  given that people are pretty conscientious about it, that's a good way   to, to work it , with a neighborhood watch.	###uh, we've been broken into  in my apartment about four times in like two and a half weeks.###speakera27.###oh, no.###speakerb28.###and one of the things that i, i helped  organize  was a neighborhood watch type situation down there.###speakera29.###uh-huh.###speakerb3.###uh, because they were just,###it's one of those things where the new thing is that they operate in the daylight because everybody went to work , you know,###speakera31.###uh-huh.###speakerb32.###and then the houses were left  unguarded ,###uh, but yeah,
169466:54	people	intelligent people	read	read these things	people	i, i'm, i totally concede that intelligent people read these things and intelligent people write them.	###and i think  the same thing is true with news.###if you want  to just have an idea as to what 's going on, most papers, a-, and especially the better papers, the, the times, the wall street journal, the washington post give you a reasonable idea.###speakera29.###uh-huh.###speakerb3.###speakera31.###yeah.###speakerb32.###if you were deeply involved in it, then you immediately realize that what they print  is stuff that you probably knew  already and the stuff that you want  they're not printing  because the average person doesn't need or want  to know that much.###speakera33.###right.### doesn't want,###speakerb34.###speakera35.### let me ask, by the way, just for the record.

176:9	things	things	cost	cost a lot more	things	well, things cost a lot more.	###i mean, there were five of us###and i don't recall, you know,  wanting anything in particular.###uh, but i don't know how my father did it .###he worked at a truck line###and he just didn't make that kind of money with five children.###but we did okay.###we had a house and a home and,###but now, my wife and i both work###and we don't, i don't believe  we have as much as my parents did###and we only have one child.###speakera6.###really?###speakerb61.###uh-huh.###speakera62.

17943:4	people	people	outlive	outlive their savings	people	people outlive their savings.	###speakera41.###yeah.###speakerb42.###i mean it is kind of fair,###but it's also not fair because they have their own children   to raise .###speakera43.###sure.###speakerb44.###so it's another problem.###speakera45.###and you probably, if it were you, you probably wouldn't want someone choosing a place  for you to live  based on lowest price.###speakerb46.###right,###right.###so, it, it's just so complicated anymore, i think  .
171285:14	people	not that many people	are	are really trying	people	and not that many people are really trying i don't think  .	###yeah.###i don't know either.###speakerb48.###speakera49.###speakerb5.###speakera51.###that's true.###speakerb52.###and they're going  to be really struggling###and i don't think that america is currently the type of environment where  struggling up from the bottom is necessarily considered  to be good .###speakera53.###right,###right.###speakerb54.###i mean, it's no longer the, the, uh, the accomplishment that it, that it once was 
171298:69	people	people	are	are having their children much later in life so that they're establishing careers	people	uh, i know  what i'm seeing  here at m-, my job is that people are having their children much later in life so that they're establishing careers	###speakerb54.###i mean, it's no longer the, the, uh, the accomplishment that it, that it once was ###and not that many people are really trying i don't think  .###speakera55.###yeah.###yeah.###that's kind of scary.###huh. well that's true.###but, i,###it's just very, very different###and i guess  every ten years it's just been very different.###speakerb56.###yeah.###speakera57.###so. and i don't know what 's going  to happen.
171355:46	juries	juries	need	need  to decide sentencing all the time	juries	well i guess  i don't think that, uh, uh, juries need  to decide sentencing all the time.	###i think  i prefer the jury system myself.###speakerb12.###you think  you prefer the jury?###you think  your chances are better?###speakera13.###uh, well, actually i think  in most criminal cases it exp wouldn't make any difference whether it was a couple of judges or jury.### what, what i worry about  is cases where it's the government against the individual .###that's where you really need a jury of peers .###because, uh, anytime  th-, the government, uh, is the government against the individual  you need som-, y-, you need the protection of ordinary citizens.###speakerb14.###well, that's true.###speakera15.###i think  that's really the only thing.###i guess  where i would like  to see the system change  is,###uh, uh, there ought  to be a, a
171383:15	people	people	tend	tend  to get whipped  up into a frenzy and slap long sentences on people	people	in texas here, people tend  to get whipped  up into a frenzy and slap long sentences on people.	### th-, the sentencing is really light compared to what i think  they should be  in a lot of cases you know,###uh,###speakera19.###yeah.###speakerb2.###speakera21.###well if you drag twelve people into a courtroom, i trust them to make the right decision as to whether someone's guilty or innocent.###that's usually a matter of who  to believe  and what facts  to believe .###speakerb22.###right.###speakera23.###but people who  d-, don't have day in and day out life long experience with what prison is really like  and what the options are ,  to ask them  to decide for one case, on one person, based on what they see , i think  that is maybe, uh, a little bit naive.###speakerb24.###yeah.###speakera25.
171391:33	people	people	bend	bend over the other way	people	but in a lot of places, i think  people bend over the other way,	###speakerb22.###right.###speakera23.###but people who  d-, don't have day in and day out life long experience with what prison is really like  and what the options are ,  to ask them  to decide for one case, on one person, based on what they see , i think  that is maybe, uh, a little bit naive.###speakerb24.###yeah.###speakera25.###in texas here, people tend  to get whipped  up into a frenzy and slap long sentences on people.###speakerb26.###uh-huh.###speakera27.###uh, it's kind of, uh, uh, a hanging jury atmosphere.###speakerb28.###right.###speakera29.
171414:6	lawyers	lawyers	blow	blow sand in their eyes	lawyers	and lawyers blow sand in their eyes.	###speakerb32.###yeah.### that's, that's not a bad system.###but i, i do think  it needs  to be shaken  up a little bit.###speakera33.###yeah.###speakerb34.###but, the thing is too,  maybe they need more of a, i don't know, more of a expert types to, to be on some of these jury cases because most time you just pick, you know, joe blow or whoever and a good citizen or whoever an-, and call them in.###speakera35.###yeah.###speakerb36.###speakera37.###right.###speakerb38.###speakera39.
