# Comparison class elicitation + prevalence elicitation

4/19/17
Only using items that are not obviously domain restricted (i.e., no "people" or "things").

Only assuming an NP-focus comparison class.

Participants generate 3 elements in comparison class (we specified comparison class NP by hand).

Later, they rate prevalence.

n = 20 ($1.25) --> $25 + 40% fee = $35
